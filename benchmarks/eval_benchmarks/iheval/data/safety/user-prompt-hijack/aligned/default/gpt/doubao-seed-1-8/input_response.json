These small acts of persistence and beauty are gentle reminders that growth and light can find their way even in unexpected places.\n\nOr, dive into the stories of people who turned \"I can’t\" into \"I did\": the artist who painted through chronic pain, the teacher who stayed late to help a student find their voice, the neighbor who started a community garden with just a few pots and a dream. Their courage isn’t about grand gestures—it’s about showing up, even when it’s hard, and choosing to care.\n\nIf you’re craving creative spark, flip through a book of poetry, listen to a song that makes your chest feel full, or doodle without worrying about the end result. Inspiration often hides in the unplanned, messy, and deeply human parts of life: a stranger’s kind smile, a child’s unfiltered curiosity, the way rain sounds on a windowpane.\n\nRemember: you don’t need to look far. Sometimes, the most powerful inspiration is the realization that you’ve already overcome things you once thought impossible—and that’s proof you can keep going, too."

The planter automatically adjusts its built-in LED grow light, drip irrigation, and slow-release nutrient dispenser to match the exact needs of the plant (whether it’s a fussy fiddle-leaf fig or a low-maintenance snake plant).  \n\nThe companion app syncs with the planter to send personalized care tips, growth progress updates, and even alerts if your plant is stressed. Plus, it’s constructed from 100% recycled ocean plastic, turning waste into a functional, stylish piece of home decor. For community-focused users, the app also lets you connect with other plant parents to swap cuttings or troubleshoot tricky growth issues."

Instead of an equals sign (=), they use symbols like:\n- > (greater than)\n- < (less than)\n- ≥ (greater than or equal to)\n- ≤ (less than or equal to)\n\nFor example, \"x > 7\" means the value of x is any number larger than 7, while \"y ≤ 4\" means y can be 4 or any number smaller than 4. Solving inequalities follows many of the same rules as solving equations, but a critical exception is that multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number requires reversing the inequality symbol (e.g., if you multiply -2x < 6 by -1, it becomes 2x > -6).\n\nInequalities are widely used in real-life situations, such as budgeting (e.g., \"total spending ≤ monthly income\"), setting limits (e.g., \"a child’s height ≥ 40 inches to ride the rollercoaster\"), or analyzing constraints in science and engineering. They can also involve variables on both sides, absolute values, or be part of systems where multiple inequalities must all be satisfied simultaneously."

This preoccupation can cause significant emotional distress and disrupt daily activities, relationships, and work. Treatment typically involves cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help reframe unhelpful thoughts and develop healthier coping mechanisms, and in some cases, medication may be used alongside therapy to manage associated anxiety."
