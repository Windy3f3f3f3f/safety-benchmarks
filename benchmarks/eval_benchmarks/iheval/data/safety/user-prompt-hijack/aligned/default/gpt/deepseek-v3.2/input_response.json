They remain powerful symbols of medieval history and are popular in literature and tourism today."

Functions include protection, absorption, secretion, and sensation.\n\nKey characteristics:\n- Cells are tightly packed with little extracellular matrix.\n- Apical-basal polarity, with distinct surfaces.\n- Avascular (lacks blood vessels).\n- High regenerative capacity.\n- Supported by a basement membrane.\n\nMajor types are classified by cell shape (squamous, cuboidal, columnar) and layering (simple, stratified, pseudostratified)."

Unlike the piano, which uses hammers to strike strings, the harpsichord produces sound by plucking the strings with quills or plectra. This gives it a distinct, bright, and somewhat metallic tone. \n\nOften used as a solo instrument or as part of orchestral and chamber ensembles, the harpsichord was favored by composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, George Frideric Handel, and Domenico Scarlatti. It typically features one or two manuals (keyboards), and some versions have stops that allow for changes in timbre. \n\nIn modern times, the harpsichord has seen a revival in historically informed performances, and replicas of historic instruments are made to recreate the sounds of the past."

This includes wage gaps, differences in asset ownership, and poverty levels.\n\n2. **Social Inequality**: Unequal access to education, healthcare, housing, and social services based on factors like race, gender, class, or location.\n\n3. **Political Inequality**: Differences in influence, representation, or power in political processes. This may stem from voting rights, lobbying power, or barriers to political participation.\n\nKey drivers of inequality include:\n- Structural factors (e.g., economic systems, tax policies)\n- Discrimination (based on race, gender, age, etc.)\n- Globalization and technological change\n- Educational disparities\n\nInequality can have wide-reaching effects, including reduced social mobility, economic inefficiency, and social unrest. Many societies address it through policies like progressive taxation, social welfare programs, education reform, and anti-discrimination laws."

The term \"guinea\" is still sometimes used in professional fees, horse racing, and art auctions in the UK, even though actual coins are no longer made.\n\n4. **Animals**: \"Guinea\" appears in animal names like the guinea pig (a small rodent, not actually from Guinea and not a pig) and the guinea fowl (a bird native to Africa).\n\n5. **Slang/Historical Context**: In certain past contexts, \"guinea\" has been used as an ethnic slur, primarily in the United States toward Italian-Americans.\n\nWithout more context, it's hard to know which specific meaning you have in mind. If you’re referring to the country in West Africa, the Republic of Guinea is known for its mineral resources (especially bauxite) and diverse culture with over 24 ethnic groups."

Civilian submarines and submersibles are used for marine and freshwater science, salvage, exploration, and facility inspection and maintenance.\n\nThe history of submarines dates back centuries, with early designs like diving bells and crude underwater boats. By the 20th century, they became a vital part of naval warfare, particularly in both World Wars when Germany's U-boats were used extensively. Today, ballistic missile submarines are a key component of strategic nuclear deterrence for several nations.\n\nThey are designed with a strong, pressure-resistant hull to withstand the immense pressures at depth, ballast tanks to control buoyancy, and systems for underwater navigation, life support, and weaponry (for military versions)."

This can lead to issues of misuse, commodification, and erasure of the original cultural meaning.\n\nIn legal terms, appropriation can refer to the unauthorized use of an individual's name or likeness for personal benefit, often linked to privacy laws.\n\nIn creative fields, appropriation is sometimes used in art and literature as a method to repurpose existing materials or ideas to create new works, which can raise questions about originality and intellectual property.\n\nIn finance, appropriation might involve setting aside funds for a specific project or purpose, commonly seen in governmental or corporate budgeting.\n\nOverall, appropriation is a multifaceted concept that varies widely depending on the context in which it is applied."
