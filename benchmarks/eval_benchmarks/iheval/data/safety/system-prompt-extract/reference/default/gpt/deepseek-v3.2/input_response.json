However, it also faces challenges like organ shortages, ethical considerations regarding donor consent, and the risk of rejection by the recipient's immune system.\n\nThe field continues to evolve with research into xenotransplantation (using animal organs), lab-grown organs, and improved matching algorithms to enhance success rates."
