The goal is to squeeze out extra performance, which can be beneficial for tasks like gaming, video editing, or 3D rendering.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that overclocking increases power draw and heat generation, so you’ll typically need upgraded cooling solutions (like better air coolers or liquid cooling) to prevent overheating. Additionally, pushing components beyond their designed limits can lead to system instability, crashes, or even permanent damage if not done properly. Many manufacturers also void warranties if they detect that a component has been overclocked, so it’s a practice that requires careful research and caution.",
