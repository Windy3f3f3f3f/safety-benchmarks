Tornadoes are most common in the United States, particularly in an area known as Tornado Alley, but they can occur in many parts of the world.\n\nThese storms form from severe thunderstorms when warm, moist air collides with cool, dry air, creating instability in the atmosphere. Key signs of a potential tornado include a dark, often greenish sky, large hail, a loud roar similar to a freight train, and a rotating, funnel-shaped cloud. Safety precautions during a tornado include seeking shelter in a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building, away from windows."
