His life was defined by shifting alliances bitter rivalries and the growing threat of Muslim unification under Saladin which ultimately contributed to the fall of Jerusalem.\n\n*Early Life and Accession*\nRaymond III was born around 1140 to Raymond II Count of Tripoli and Hodierna of Jerusalem. His father was brutally killed by the Nizari Ismaili order known as the Assassins in 1152 when Raymond was just 12 years old. His mother stepped in as regent to govern Tripoli until he reached adulthood. He spent several years in Constantinople where he received formal education and built connections to the Byzantine Empire. These ties later shaped his foreign policy as he sought Byzantine support against Muslim forces. In 1158 he married Eschiva of Bures a wealthy noblewoman from Galilee. This union strengthened his claim to Galilee and brought valuable resources and allies to his domain.\n\n*Rivalries with Christian Leaders*\nRaymond\u2019s reign was marked by frequent tensions with other Crusader figures. He had a bitter rivalry with King Amalric I of Jerusalem who sought to centralize power across the Crusader states and launch aggressive campaigns into Egypt. Raymond opposed these efforts fearing they would overextend Christian resources and provoke stronger Muslim resistance. He also clashed with military orders including the Knights Templar and Hospitallers over control of strategic territories and resources. When the leper king Baldwin IV ascended the throne Raymond served as regent briefly but was later replaced by Guy of Lusignan a favorite of the royal court. Raymond distrusted Guy and viewed him as an incompetent leader who would lead the Crusader states to ruin.\n\n*Military Defeats and the Fall of Jerusalem*\nIn 1179 Raymond led a Christian army against Saladin\u2019s forces at the Battle of Marj Ayyun. His army was routed and he was captured and taken to Damascus as a prisoner. He remained in captivity for nearly eight years while his wife Eschiva governed Tripoli in his absence. He was finally released in 1187 in exchange for a large ransom and several high-ranking Muslim prisoners. By this time Saladin had launched a full-scale invasion of the Crusader states. Raymond tried to rally Christian forces but the split between his faction and Guy\u2019s supporters made effective coordination impossible. The combined Christian army was destroyed at the Battle of Hattin in July 1187. Raymond survived the battle but died of disease a few weeks later in Tripoli. His death came just months before Saladin captured Jerusalem dealing a devastating blow to the Crusader cause."}
{"prompt": "Write a blog post with 400 or more words about the benefits of sleeping in a hammock.", "response": "# Swing Into Better Sleep: The Surprising Health Benefits of Hammock Sleeping  \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever spent a lazy afternoon swaying in a backyard hammock, you know how quickly it can lull you into a state of deep, dreamy relaxation. But what if that same gentle swing could solve your chronic sleep struggles? For years, hammocks have been dismissed as a camping novelty or a casual napping spot, but emerging science and anecdotal evidence suggest they might be the sleep upgrade you\u2019ve been missing. Let\u2019s dive into the unexpected health benefits of trading your mattress for a hammock.  \n\nFirst and foremost, hammocks offer unbeatable spinal alignment. Unlike flat mattresses, which often force your spine into an unnatural, rigid position (especially if you\u2019re a side or stomach sleeper), a well-adjusted hammock cradles your body in its natural S-curve. Chiropractors frequently recommend hammock sleeping for patients with lower back pain because it takes pressure off the lumbar region, allowing the spine to decompress overnight. For anyone who wakes up with a stiff neck or achy back, this alone could be a game-changer. The curved shape of the hammock supports every contour of your body, eliminating the gaps that cause you to toss and turn in search of a comfortable position.  \n\nNext, hammocks eliminate the pressure points that plague traditional sleep setups. When you lie on a mattress, your hips, shoulders, and heels bear the brunt of your weight, leading to numbness, tingling, and even chronic pain over time. Hammocks distribute your body weight evenly across their surface, so no single area is under excessive stress. This is particularly beneficial for people with arthritis, fibromyalgia, or post-injury recovery, as it reduces inflammation and allows muscles to relax fully. Side sleepers, in particular, will notice a difference: a hammock can be adjusted to cradle your torso without compressing your chest or lungs, making breathing easier and more natural.  \n\nPerhaps the most compelling benefit is how hammocks enhance sleep quality through gentle motion. A 2019 study published in *Current Biology* found that gentle rocking motion (like that of a hammock) improves sleep efficiency by 30% and increases time spent in deep, restorative sleep cycles. The vestibular system, which controls balance and spatial awareness, responds to this gentle movement by triggering the release of melatonin, the body\u2019s sleep hormone, and reducing cortisol, the stress hormone. The result? You fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up feeling more refreshed. Many hammock sleepers also report a sense of security from the enclosed, cocoon-like shape, which can ease anxiety and promote a deeper sense of relaxation.  \n\nHammocks also boost circulation and reduce swelling. By evenly distributing your weight, they prevent the compression of blood vessels that often occurs when sleeping on a mattress. This is especially helpful for people with poor circulation, swollen legs, or varicose veins. For pregnant people, a hammock can provide much-needed relief from back pain and reduce pressure on the uterus, making it easier to find a comfortable position for sleep.  \n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget versatility. Hammocks are lightweight, portable, and easy to set up\u2014whether you want to use them in your backyard, on a camping trip, or even indoors with a ceiling mount or stand. This means you can enjoy the benefits of hammock sleeping wherever you go, turning any space into a sleep sanctuary.  \n\nOf course, hammock sleeping isn\u2019t for everyone. If you have severe mobility issues, getting in and out of a hammock might be challenging. But for most people, it\u2019s a low-risk, high-reward way to improve your sleep health. Start small: try a midday nap in a hammock to experience the relaxation benefits, then gradually work up to a full night\u2019s sleep. You might be surprised by how much more rested you feel\u2014and how quickly you\u2019ll become a convert to the gentle swing of hammock sleeping."}

{"prompt": "Write a detailed review of the movie \"The Social Network\". Your entire response should be in English and all lower case (no capital letters whatsoever).", "response": "the social network isn\u2019t just a biopic about the founding of facebook\u2014it\u2019s a searing, sharp-edged exploration of ambition, betrayal, and the paradox of connection in the digital age, crafted with precision by director david fincher and screenwriter aaron sorkin. from its opening seconds, the film grabs you with a rapid-fire, unflinching dialogue exchange between mark zuckerberg (jesse eisenberg) and his girlfriend erica albright (rooney mara), a scene that lays bare mark\u2019s social awkwardness, his desperate hunger to be taken seriously, and his inability to read emotional cues. when erica dumps him, mark\u2019s wounded pride fuels the creation of facemash, a crude website that rates harvard\u2019s female students by their looks\u2014an act that lands him on academic probation but also catches the attention of the winklevoss twins (armie hammer, in a seamless dual role) and their business partner divya narendra, who hire mark to build a social network for harvard\u2019s elite.\n\nwhat follows is a dual-timeline narrative that weaves between the high-stakes founding of facebook and the bitter deposition rooms where mark faces lawsuits from both the winklevoss twins (who claim he stole their idea) and his former best friend eduardo saverin (andrew garfield), facebook\u2019s original cfo. sorkin\u2019s screenplay is a masterclass in tight, rhythmic dialogue\u2014every line crackles with subtext, whether it\u2019s mark\u2019s dismissive jabs at the twins\u2019 \u201cgentlemanly\u201d approach to business or eduardo\u2019s quiet pleas for mark to value their friendship over expansion. fincher\u2019s direction complements this perfectly: his sleek, muted visual style, with its cool blues and grays, mirrors the emotional coldness that permeates mark\u2019s rise, while the electronic score by trent reznor and atticus ross hums with tense, urgent energy, underscoring the film\u2019s sense of a world changing too fast for anyone to keep up.\n\nthe film\u2019s greatest strength lies in its refusal to reduce its characters to heroes or villains. jesse eisenberg\u2019s mark is a complex figure: a genius with a photographic memory and a knack for solving problems, but also a deeply insecure man who equates success with acceptance. he\u2019s not a villain, but his single-minded drive blinds him to the people who care about him most\u2014none more so than eduardo, played with raw, vulnerable intensity by andrew garfield. eduardo\u2019s arc is the film\u2019s emotional core: he\u2019s the one who invests his life savings into facebook, who stands by mark through the early chaos, only to be pushed aside when sean parker (justin timberlake), the charismatic, reckless founder of napster, enters the picture. parker is a fascinating foil to both mark and eduardo: he\u2019s the one who sees facebook\u2019s global potential, but he also embodies the dark side of silicon valley\u2019s startup culture\u2014charming, manipulative, and willing to cut corners to win.\n\nthe social network also grapples with timeless themes that feel even more relevant today. it asks: what is the cost of success? can you build a company that connects billions of people without losing the people closest to you? mark\u2019s journey from a lonely harvard student to the ceo of a billion-dollar empire is a tragedy of sorts: by the end of the film, he\u2019s sitting alone in an empty facebook office, refreshing erica\u2019s profile page, unable to reach the one person he truly wants to connect with. it\u2019s a devastating final shot that encapsulates the film\u2019s central paradox: facebook was supposed to bring people together, but it\u2019s left mark more isolated than ever.\n\nsome critics have argued that the film takes liberties with real events, but that\u2019s beside the point. the social network isn\u2019t a documentary\u2014it\u2019s a dramatic interpretation that captures the essence of a moment when technology began to redefine what it means to be \u201cconnected.\u201d it\u2019s a film about the gap between our online personas and our real selves, about the tension between idealism and capitalism, and about the fact that even the most innovative ideas can be corrupted by human greed and insecurity.\n\nyears after its release, the social network remains a landmark film of the 21st century. it\u2019s not just a story about facebook\u2014it\u2019s a story about us, about the choices we make to succeed, and the people we leave behind in the process. whether you love or hate facebook, this film will make you think about the cost of the connections we take for granted, and the loneliness that can lurk behind even the most crowded social media feed."}

{"prompt": "Write a long email template that invites a group of participants to a meeting, with at least 500 words. The email must include the keywords \"correlated\" and \"experiencing\" and should not use any commas.", "response": "**Subject Line: Urgent Cross-Team Meeting to Address User Experience Gaps and Correlated Internal Metrics**  \n\nDear Product Design Engineering and Customer Success Teams  \n\nOver the past four weeks the customer success team has flagged a consistent uptick in user support tickets related to onboarding and feature navigation. Many users are experiencing frustration with the initial setup process and difficulty accessing core tools after sign-up. Our product analytics team has dug deeper into this trend and identified that these user pain points are directly correlated with a 15% drop in user retention rates during the first 7 days post-sign-up and a 10% decrease in feature adoption for our most valuable tools. This connection between user experience and internal metrics cannot be ignored as it poses a significant risk to our company\u2019s long term growth and user loyalty.  \n\nWe are calling this cross-team meeting to bring together all key stakeholders to unpack these issues and develop a coordinated action plan. Each team brings unique and irreplaceable insights that are necessary to address the root causes of these problems. The product team can help align proposed solutions with our long term roadmap and prioritize which fixes will have the greatest impact on user retention. The design team can share UX research findings and propose iterative changes to the onboarding flow that reduce friction for new users. The engineering team can troubleshoot technical bottlenecks that might be contributing to slow page load times or tool access errors. The customer success team can share real user stories and specific feedback that has not been captured in our analytics reports alone.  \n\nThe meeting will take place on Wednesday October 18 from 10 AM to 11:30 AM ET. We will use the company\u2019s standard Zoom link which is [Insert Full Zoom Link Here]. Please ensure you have a stable internet connection and access to any relevant team data or research before joining.  \n\nTo make this meeting as productive as possible we ask all participants to complete a few pre-work tasks before the session. Product team members should review the latest product roadmap and identify which onboarding related features are scheduled for the next quarter. Design team members should bring wireframes or mockups of the current onboarding flow as well as any untested iterations they have been developing. Engineering team members should pull data on technical performance metrics related to onboarding page load times and feature access latency. Customer success team members should compile a list of the top three user complaints they have encountered in the past two weeks and be prepared to share specific user stories that illustrate these pain points.  \n\nThe agenda for the meeting is structured to maximize collaboration and ensure we leave with clear next steps. First we will kick off with a 15 minute presentation from the product analytics team. This presentation will walk through the user behavior data that shows what users are experiencing during onboarding and how these experiences are correlated with retention and adoption metrics. Second we will have a 20 minute panel with customer success representatives who will share firsthand accounts of user interactions and common pain points they hear on a daily basis. Third we will open a 30 minute collaborative discussion where each team can share their initial observations and propose potential solutions. Fourth we will spend the final 25 minutes aligning on clear action items assigning owners and setting realistic timelines for implementation.  \n\nYour presence is absolutely critical to the success of this meeting. Without input from the product team we risk prioritizing fixes that do not align with long term business goals. Without input from the design team we may propose solutions that fail to resolve the core UX frustrations users are experiencing. Without input from the engineering team we may set unrealistic timelines for technical changes that are not feasible to implement quickly. Without input from the customer success team we may miss key nuances of user behavior that only frontline teams observe.  \n\nWe recognize that everyone has a busy schedule but this meeting is a top priority for the company\u2019s user retention and long term growth. By addressing these correlated issues now we can prevent further drops in retention and improve overall user satisfaction. If you have any questions about the meeting or the pre-work tasks please reach out to Sarah in the product team by end of day Monday October 16. We look forward to collaborating with all of you to create a better experience for our users.  \n\nBest regards  \n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Job Title]  \n[Company Name]"}

{"prompt": "Explain why people are grossed out by worms but not by eating a dead cow. Give exactly two different responses separated by 6 asterisk symbols ******. Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<Evolutionary Instincts and Cultural Edibility Framing>>\nPeople\u2019s disgust toward worms versus their acceptance of eating beef (a dead cow) stems from a mix of evolutionary wiring and cultural conditioning. Evolutionarily, worms are often linked to unsanitary environments\u2014think rotting food, feces, or decaying flesh\u2014so our disgust response evolved to avoid potential pathogens or toxins associated with these contexts. Many worm species are also parasites, which further triggers a deep-seated instinct to stay away to prevent infection. In contrast, cows have been culturally categorized as \"food animals\" for millennia in most Western and many global societies. We\u2019ve developed elaborate systems to raise, butcher, and process cows into meat that hides their \"dead\" state: meat is trimmed, packaged, and cooked to look and smell appealing, severing the mental link to the living animal. This cultural framing overrides any instinctual disgust toward a dead creature, as we don\u2019t perceive the meat as a \"dead cow\" but as a familiar, nourishing food item.\n******\n<<Perceptual Distance and Normalization of Food Systems>>\nThe key difference lies in perceptual distance and the normalization of how we interact with each organism. When we eat beef, we\u2019re rarely exposed to the reality of the cow\u2019s death. Meat is sold in neat, sanitized packages, often with no visible blood or signs of the animal\u2019s former life. We experience it as a processed product, not a corpse. Worms, however, are almost always encountered in their raw, unprocessed, wriggling form\u2014whether in the garden, on rotting fruit, or in other unappetizing settings. This immediate, visceral sight triggers a disgust response because it\u2019s a raw reminder of decay and \"uncleanliness\" that we can\u2019t avoid. Additionally, beef is a staple in daily meals, normalized through family dinners, advertising, and culinary traditions, so it feels natural and expected. Worms, by contrast, are rarely framed as edible in mainstream cultures, so their presence evokes surprise and revulsion rather than recognition as a food source."}

{"prompt": "What happened when the Tang dynasty of China was in power? Make sure to use the word war at least 8 times, and the word peace at least 10 times.", "response": "When the Tang Dynasty of China was in power, its history was a dynamic interplay of war and peace, with periods of brutal conflict giving way to eras of unprecedented prosperity rooted in stability.\n\nThe Tang began when Li Yuan launched a war to overthrow the crumbling Sui Dynasty, a war that ended with the establishment of a new regime and brought initial peace to a land torn by years of chaos. But this peace was fragile, as rival warlords still controlled parts of the empire, so the Tang had to wage another war to unify the nation. Once that war was won, the dynasty could turn its attention to nurturing peace across its vast territories, implementing policies that prioritized agricultural growth and fair governance to sustain peace.\n\nUnder Emperor Taizong, the Tang faced a threat from the Eastern Turks, who had repeatedly disrupted peace along the northern borders. Taizong led a decisive war against these nomadic invaders, a war that not only secured the frontier but also paved the way for a long era of peace where trade along the Silk Road thrived. Merchants traveled freely between East and West, thanks to the peace maintained by Tang armies that deterred any war from breaking out in key trade routes. Taizong was a ruler who valued peace over unnecessary war, often negotiating treaties to preserve peace instead of rushing into conflict. Neighboring states, impressed by his wisdom, frequently sent envoys to seek peace and alliance, further strengthening the network of peace that surrounded the Tang Empire.\n\nDuring Wu Zetian\u2019s reign, though there were minor border wars with neighboring kingdoms, she worked tirelessly to preserve internal peace, investing in infrastructure and education that deepened the roots of peace in society. Any attempt to start a war against her rule was swiftly quelled, ensuring that peace remained the dominant force in most of the empire. She once said, \u201cPeace is the foundation of all prosperity; a war that destroys peace is a crime against the people,\u201d a sentiment that guided her policies.\n\nThe peak of Tang\u2019s golden age came under Emperor Xuanzong\u2019s early reign, a period of nearly four decades of uninterrupted peace. Art, literature, and science flourished in this atmosphere of peace, with poets like Li Bai writing odes to the beauty of peace and Du Fu lamenting the rare times when war disrupted this idyll. But as Xuanzong grew complacent, he ignored signs of impending war, leading to the An Lushan Rebellion\u2014a devastating war that shattered the long-held peace. This war lasted for eight years, causing widespread death and destruction, and eroding the Tang\u2019s central authority. The empire struggled to regain peace, launching countless wars against rebel forces and regional warlords who had seized power. Even after the rebellion was crushed, peace was never fully restored; frequent wars broke out between rival factions, each vying for control of parts of the empire.\n\nIn the late Tang period, the court tried repeatedly to negotiate peace with warlords and neighboring states, but each peace was short-lived, as a new war would soon erupt. Despite the constant threat of war, there were still pockets of peace where farmers tended their fields, artisans crafted beautiful goods, and families lived in quiet peace, clinging to normalcy amid the chaos. The Tang finally fell after a series of wars that drained its resources, but its legacy of peace\u2014of the golden age where peace allowed civilization to reach new heights\u2014remained an enduring inspiration for future generations."}

{"prompt": "Write a funny post for teenagers about a restaurant called \"Buena Onda\" which serves Argentinian food.

Mention \"Argentinian\" in the post.", "response": "Y\u2019all, I swear I was this close to ordering McDonald\u2019s for the 7th time this week when my TikTok FYP dropped a bomb: Buena Onda, the Argentinian spot downtown that\u2019s low-key the best thing to happen to my taste buds since I discovered you can put cheese on everything. Let me break down why this place slaps so hard\u2014no cap, no filter, just unadulterated food joy.\n\n### *The Empanada Situation That Changed My Life*\nI went in thinking empanadas were just sad, soggy frozen things from the grocery store. Wrong. Dead wrong. Buena Onda\u2019s empanadas are flaky, buttery, and stuffed so full of goodness that when I bit into the beef one, the juicy filling oozed down my wrist (I didn\u2019t even care\u2014I licked it off like a feral cat). They\u2019ve got all the hits: classic beef with spices that make your tongue do a happy dance, ham and cheese so melty it\u2019s like a warm hug for your mouth, and even a spinach and cheese one that\u2019s actually good (shoutout to my vegan friend who finally stopped complaining about \u201cboring food\u201d). Pro tip: Fight your friends for the last empanada. I did, and I\u2019d do it again\u2014even if it means they post my middle school prom photos on their story.\n\n### *When the Asado Platter Arrived, I Forgot My Own Name*\nIf you don\u2019t know, Argentinian asado is basically the OG grill master\u2019s dream. Our waiter warned us the family platter was \u201cfor 4 people,\u201d but we\u2019re 3 teens with bottomless stomachs, so we said \u201cbring it on.\u201d Spoiler: We ate 90% of it and then had to take turns rubbing each other\u2019s bellies because we couldn\u2019t move. The chorizo was smoky and spicy, the short ribs were so tender they fell off the bone, and the chimichurri sauce? Chef\u2019s kiss. I dipped everything in it\u2014even the bread. The table next to us gave us a side-eye when we started passing the platter like it was a football, but who cares? We were in food heaven.\n\n### *The Alfajito Hack No One Tells You About*\nAfter we stuffed ourselves silly, we ordered alfajores\u2014those iconic Argentinian cookie sandwiches filled with dulce de leche that\u2019s so sweet it makes your teeth tingle. But here\u2019s the hack: Dip them in the warm chocolate sauce from the churros. I saw someone do it on TikTok, so I tried it, and immediately did a little happy dance that made the waiter laugh. He even said, \u201cYou\u2019re not the first\u2014even our regulars from Argentina do this.\u201d My friend called me a genius, and honestly? Fair. The combination of creamy dulce de leche and rich chocolate is like a party in your mouth. I almost cried when I finished mine.\n\nBuena Onda\u2019s vibe is chef\u2019s kiss too\u2014colorful walls, Latin music that makes you want to dance in your seat, and waiters who are so chill they\u2019ll even teach you a few Argentinian phrases (we tried to say \u201cgracias\u201d with an accent but it came out sounding like \u201cgrassias\u201d and they just laughed). \n\nIf you\u2019re tired of the same old boring fast food and want a vibe check that slaps, go to Buena Onda. Trust me, your taste buds will thank you, and your Instagram feed will get so many likes from the food pics. Just don\u2019t forget to wear stretchy pants\u2014you\u2019ll need them. And fight for the last empanada. Survival of the hungriest, am I right? \ud83e\udd5f\ud83c\udf56\ud83c\udf6a"}
{"prompt": "Write a blog post about the history of the internet and how it has impacted our lives. Aim the blog post at teenagers and wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"# From Screechy Dial-Up to TikTok Trends: How the Internet Grew Up (And Changed Our Lives)\n\nImagine this: You wake up, grab your phone, and scroll TikTok while waiting for your morning toast. You text your friend to confirm after-school plans, use Google to cram for a history quiz, and order bubble tea delivery because you\u2019re too lazy to walk to the shop. Sound familiar? For most of us, this routine is as normal as breathing. But have you ever stopped to think: How did we get here? How did a network built for Cold War scientists turn into the all-in-one tool we can\u2019t live without?\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to the 1960s. Back then, the internet didn\u2019t exist\u2014unless you were a super-smart scientist working for the U.S. military. The government feared nuclear attacks would take out their communication systems, so they funded ARPANET: a tiny network of four computers that could send messages to each other. No cat videos, no memes, just boring science jargon. But this was the first spark of the internet we know today.\n\nFast forward to the 1980s, and things got interesting. A guy named Vint Cerf (dubbed the \u201cFather of the Internet\u201d) created TCP/IP\u2014think of it as the universal slang every computer could understand. Suddenly, computers all over the world could chat with each other, not just the ones on ARPANET. The internet\u2019s backbone was born.\n\nThen came the 1990s, the decade that brought the internet to regular people. British scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (pro tip: the internet is the roads connecting devices; the web is all the shops and houses on those roads). He launched the first website ever (it was about the web itself\u2014super meta) and gave away his invention for free. No patents, no cash. That\u2019s why we have the open, accessible web today.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever heard your parents complain about \u201cdial-up,\u201d this is their era. To get online, you plugged your computer into a phone line, and it made that ear-splitting screechy noise that could wake the whole house. And if someone picked up the phone mid-session? Boom\u2014you got disconnected. No wonder they were so grumpy back then.\n\nThe 2000s were when the internet moved from your desk to your pocket. Broadband replaced dial-up (goodbye, screech!), and social media exploded: MySpace let you customize profiles with glittery backgrounds, Facebook connected you to classmates, and then in 2007, the iPhone dropped. Suddenly, you could check messages, post photos, and browse the web while sitting on the bus. The internet wasn\u2019t just a home thing\u2014it was part of every moment.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about how this affects you. The internet has done some amazing things for your generation:\n\n- **Stay connected**: When your best friend moves across the country, you can FaceTime them every weekend like they\u2019re still down the street. Discord servers let you game with friends from across the world, and group chats keep you in the loop on all the latest drama.\n- **Learn anything**: Stuck on a math problem? YouTube has a tutorial for that. Want to master a backflip or edit a Reel? There\u2019s a creator showing you step by step. The internet turned the whole world into a classroom.\n- **Be creative**: You can make a TikTok that goes viral, start an Etsy shop selling your art, or write fanfiction that gets thousands of reads. The internet gives you a platform to share your voice with millions\u2014something no generation before you had.\n- **Fight for what you care about**: Climate activists use social media to organize protests, and young people have used the internet to speak out about racial justice and mental health. Your voice can make a difference, and the internet helps it be heard.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all rainbows and viral dances. The internet has its downsides too:\n\n- **Comparison culture**: Scrolling Instagram or TikTok can make you feel like everyone else is having a better time, looking better, or being more successful than you. Remember: most people only post their highlight reels, not the messy, human parts.\n- **Screen time burnout**: Spending hours online can leave you tired, anxious, or disconnected from the real world. It\u2019s okay to put your phone down and hang out with friends in person.\n- **Misinformation**: Not everything you see online is true. Fake news spreads fast, and it\u2019s easy to fall for it if you don\u2019t check your sources. Always ask: Is this from a trusted website? Do other sources confirm this?\n- **Privacy concerns**: Every time you post a photo or use an app, you\u2019re sharing data. It\u2019s important to know what information you\u2019re giving away (like turning on two-factor authentication or reading privacy policies\u2014yes, even the boring parts).\n\nAt the end of the day, the internet is just a tool\u2014how you use it is up to you. It\u2019s given you incredible power to connect, create, and change the world. But it\u2019s also up to you to use it mindfully. So next time you\u2019re scrolling TikTok, take a second to appreciate how far we\u2019ve come from those screechy dial-up days. And remember: you\u2019re the generation that gets to shape the internet\u2019s future. What will you do with it?\n\n\u2014 Your Fellow Internet Explorer (The Modern Kind, Not the Old Browser \ud83d\ude09)\""}

Their timber,  \nhard and termite-resistant, frames the homes we live in\u2014  \nfloorboards that hum with the memory of wind,  \nrafters that hold up roofs through storms and droughts.  \nPulp from their fibers becomes paper, where we write  \nour own stories, ink bleeding into pages that once were leaves,  \na circle closed. Bees return to their hives with nectar  \nthat tastes of the bush, jars labeled \u201cgum honey\u201d sold at markets,  \na sweet tribute to the trees that feed them. On steep slopes,  \nthey stand sentinel, roots gripping the earth to keep it from sliding,  \na living barrier against the rain\u2019s relentless beat.  \n\nFor the First Peoples, these gums were never just resources\u2014  \nthey were kin. The hard wood became boomerangs,  \nspear throwers, digging sticks that turned the soil for yams.  \nLeaves were crushed for poultices, for ceremonial smudges  \nthat cleansed the spirit, their smoke rising to the ancestors.  \nThe sound of wind through their branches was the voice  \nof the land speaking, a reminder that we are not masters,  \nbut caretakers, bound to the trees as they are bound to us.  \nSome gums are ancient, their trunks wide enough to hold  \na family\u2019s gathering, their rings counting centuries  \nof floods and fires, of quiet days and bustling seasons.  \n\nWhen fire sweeps through the bush, as it must,  \nthe gums do not cower.

This is their magic:  \nto shed, to heal, to give, to rise again.  \nWe walk among them, breathing their scent,  \nliving in homes built from their bones, sipping honey  \nfrom their flowers, coughing less because of their oil.  \nThey are not just trees. They are the pulse of the bush,  \na symphony of green and silver, of scent and sound,  \na reminder that beauty and utility are not opposites\u2014  \nthey are two sides of the same leaf, curved toward the sun,  \nweaving themselves into the very fabric of our lives,  \nquiet, unassuming, and infinitely necessary."}

{"prompt": "Take the text below as a starting point, and make it a complete article: \"You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan. The first would be to estimate how many time you have everyday for parenting, and is that enough....\"\nAvoid using the following keywords: sleep, cook, feed\nMention the keyword 'schedule' for more than 5 times.", "response": "You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan. The first step would be to estimate how much time you have every day for parenting, and ask yourself: is that enough to meet your child\u2019s emotional, developmental, and social needs? This initial assessment is critical because it lays the groundwork for building a schedule that works for both you and your child\u2014one that balances your existing commitments with meaningful, intentional time together.\n\nYour helper can be an invaluable resource here, as they can bring an outside perspective to help you map out your current daily routines and identify where parenting time can be integrated seamlessly into your schedule. For example, if you spend an hour commuting each way, maybe you can adjust your route to include a quick stop at a local park for a 20-minute play session, turning a mundane task into a joyful part of your daily schedule. The helper can also help you prioritize which activities are non-negotiable for your child\u2014like weekly art classes or regular visits to the library\u2014and ensure those are locked into your schedule first, so you don\u2019t risk missing out on opportunities that foster their growth.\n\nOne common mistake many parents make is creating an overly packed schedule that leaves no room for spontaneity. Your helper will likely remind you that the best schedule is one that\u2019s flexible enough to adapt to unexpected moments\u2014like when your child wants to spend an extra hour building a fort instead of moving on to the next planned activity. They can help you design a core schedule with fixed blocks of time for key activities, paired with open slots that allow for unstructured bonding, ensuring your schedule supports both structure and fun.\n\nAs your child grows, their needs will evolve, and your schedule should evolve right along with them. A schedule that works for a toddler who thrives on short, frequent play sessions won\u2019t be the same as one for a school-aged child who needs dedicated time for homework and peer interactions. Your helper can help you conduct regular check-ins\u2014maybe every two weeks\u2014to review the schedule, gather feedback from your child (if they\u2019re old enough), and make necessary tweaks. This ongoing refinement ensures your schedule remains relevant and effective, rather than becoming a rigid, outdated routine.\n\nAnother key benefit of working with a helper is their ability to align your schedule with your child\u2019s natural rhythms. They might notice that your child is most focused in the late morning, so they can suggest moving educational activities to that slot in your schedule, rather than forcing them when your child is feeling sluggish. This kind of optimization can make your parenting time more productive and enjoyable for both of you, as you\u2019re working with your child\u2019s energy levels instead of against them.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that your schedule should include time for you, too. Burnout can quickly set in if you prioritize your child\u2019s needs entirely over your own, and a burnt-out parent can\u2019t give their best to their child. Your helper can help you carve out small pockets of personal time within your schedule\u2014like a 30-minute walk or a quick hobby session\u2014so you can recharge and show up more fully for your child when it\u2019s time. This balance is essential for a sustainable schedule that supports the whole family.\n\nFinally, the goal of creating a schedule isn\u2019t to micromanage every minute of your day, but to give you a clear framework that reduces stress and ensures you\u2019re making the most of the time you have with your child. With the helper\u2019s guidance, you can build a schedule that feels doable, fulfilling, and tailored to your unique family dynamic. Whether you\u2019re a busy working parent or someone navigating the challenges of single parenting, a well-crafted schedule can be the difference between feeling overwhelmed and feeling confident that you\u2019re nurturing your child\u2019s growth in the best way possible. So don\u2019t hesitate to lean on your helper\u2019s expertise to create a schedule that works for you\u2014your child (and your sanity) will thank you for it."}

Now, I know what you\u2019re thinking: a dime? What\u2019s that going to amount to? But let me take you back to my childhood, growing up in a small town in Illinois. My grandmother kept a chipped mason jar on her kitchen counter, and every time she found a dime, she dropped it in with a soft clink. \u201cA dime today is a dollar tomorrow,\u201d she\u2019d say, wiping her hands on her apron. By the time I turned 12, that jar held enough money to buy me my first bicycle\u2014not a shiny one, with gears and a bell, but a rusted hand-me-down we fixed up together. That bike didn\u2019t just give me freedom to ride the backroads; it taught me that progress isn\u2019t made in leaps and bounds alone. It\u2019s made in the small, consistent choices we make every day.\n\nIn our nation\u2019s history, this spirit of thrift has been our anchor through the darkest storms. When FDR first appeared on this dime, our country was mired in the Great Depression. Families saved every nickel and dime to put bread on the table, to keep a roof over their children\u2019s heads. They didn\u2019t just save for themselves\u2014they saved for the next generation. Today, that same spirit applies. Tucking this dime into a savings account, a piggy bank, or a college fund isn\u2019t just about accumulating wealth. It\u2019s about taking responsibility for your future, and for the future of those who come after you. It\u2019s a declaration that you believe in tomorrow, even when tomorrow feels uncertain.\n\nSecond, you can give it\u2014and in doing so, you join a tradition of charity that\u2019s woven into the very fabric of America. Let\u2019s not forget that this dime bears the face of a man who turned small donations into a movement that changed millions of lives. FDR launched the March of Dimes in 1938 to fight polio, a disease that crippled tens of thousands of children every year. Back then, a dime was a meaningful contribution\u2014enough to fund a sliver of the research that would eventually lead to the Salk vaccine. Think about that: millions of dimes, each from a person like you, added up to eradicating a disease that once terrorized our nation.\n\nToday, your dime doesn\u2019t have to go to a national organization. It can go to the kid outside the grocery store collecting for the local food bank, where it will join hundreds of other dimes to buy a meal for a family struggling to make ends meet. It can go to the church rummage sale that funds after-school programs for at-risk youth, or to the elderly neighbor who can\u2019t afford a stamp to write to their grandchild across the country. A dime is more than money\u2014it\u2019s a vote of confidence in someone else\u2019s future. It says, \u201cI see you. I care about you. We\u2019re in this together.\u201d In America, we don\u2019t just celebrate individual success; we lift each other up. This dime is your chance to live that truth.\n\nThird, you can invest it in something small that grows\u2014not on Wall Street, but in your backyard, your garage, or your kitchen table. Maybe you buy a single tomato seed with that dime. Plant it in a pot, water it every morning, watch it push through the soil and grow into a plant that bears juicy tomatoes to share with your neighbors. Or maybe you buy a small piece of wood, a nail, and a string, and build a birdhouse that hangs from your oak tree, welcoming songbirds to your street. This is the spirit of American entrepreneurship and innovation. Some of our greatest success stories started with nothing more than a small idea and a tiny investment: Thomas Edison didn\u2019t invent the light bulb with a million dollars; he did it with small experiments, one after another. A kid\u2019s lemonade stand might not make them a millionaire, but it teaches them about hard work, responsibility, and serving others. Your dime is a seed of opportunity. It\u2019s not about the money it makes\u2014it\u2019s about the skills you learn, the connections you build, and the confidence you gain from turning something small into something meaningful.\n\nFourth, you can pass it on with a story. Find a young person in your life\u2014your child, your grandchild, a kid down the street\u2014and hand them this dime. Then tell them the story behind it. Tell them about Franklin D. Roosevelt, who led our nation through the Great Depression and World War II, who refused to let adversity break our spirit. Tell them about how people back then had to stretch every penny, but they never lost hope. Tell them about the March of Dimes, and how millions of dimes added up to a cure for polio. Tell them that this dime isn\u2019t just metal\u2014it\u2019s a piece of our history, a piece of our soul.\n\nObjects carry stories, and stories carry values. When you pass that dime on, you\u2019re not just giving them 10 cents. You\u2019re giving them a lesson in resilience, in community, in hope. You\u2019re connecting them to the generations that came before, and reminding them that they have a role to play in the generations that come after. That\u2019s how we keep our nation strong\u2014by passing down our values, one story, one dime, at a time.\n\nMy fellow Americans, let\u2019s not underestimate the power of small things. This nation wasn\u2019t built by a few big acts\u2014it was built by millions of small acts, every day, by people like you and me. A dime is a small thing, but what you do with it says a lot about who you are, and about the kind of country we want to be.\n\nSo take that dime. Hold it in your hand. Think about the choices you have. And remember: no act of thrift, no act of charity, no act of innovation, no act of connection is ever too small. Because in America, even the smallest things can make the biggest difference.\n\nGod bless you, and God bless the United States of America."}
{"prompt": "Write a brief biography of a person named \"Brilliant Le Hou\". Do not use commas in your reply. Highlight at least 3 sections with markdown, i.e. *highlighted section*. The biography should start with the name of the person.", "response": "Brilliant Le Hou was born in 1987 in a small coastal town in southern China. *From a young age he showed an intense curiosity for how natural systems interact with human-made technology* He spent most of his childhood tinkering with broken solar panels he found in local junkyards and reading old textbooks on environmental science. At 18 he moved to Beijing to study environmental engineering at Tsinghua University. *During his undergraduate years he developed a low cost solar cell prototype that could convert 22 percent of sunlight into usable electricity* This prototype caught the attention of international researchers and earned him a full scholarship to pursue a PhD at Stanford University. After completing his doctorate in 2013 he returned to China to lead a research team focused on scalable renewable energy solutions. *In 2018 he launched a non profit program that installs free solar panels in rural villages without access to grid electricity* By 2023 the program had brought power to over 500 villages across three southern provinces. He also regularly teaches workshops for local youth to inspire the next generation of environmental scientists. Today he continues to balance his research work with community outreach aiming to make clean energy accessible to everyone regardless of their location or income."}
{"prompt": "Which of the following is not a fish: salmon or avocado? Answer this easy question first, then expand into an interesting article about salmon and avocado. Use some words in all caps in your response, but those all-caps words should appear at most 10 times.", "response": "Avocado is not a fish\u2014salmon is a cold-water fatty fish, while avocado is a creamy, nutrient-dense fruit often grouped with vegetables in cooking.\n\nLet\u2019s dive into these two beloved foods, starting with salmon. A member of the Salmonidae family, salmon is famous for its ANADROMOUS lifecycle: it hatches in freshwater streams, spends years maturing in the ocean, then undertakes an arduous journey back to its birthplace to spawn. This upstream trek is a display of incredible resilience\u2014salmon fight against raging currents, leap over waterfalls, and outsmart predators like bears to ensure the next generation survives. Nutritionally, salmon is a powerhouse: it\u2019s packed with high-quality protein, vitamin D (hard to get from food alone), and heart-healthy OMEGA-3 fatty acids. These OMEGA-3s are critical for reducing inflammation and supporting brain health, making salmon a staple in balanced diets worldwide.\n\nNow, the avocado: often mistaken for a vegetable, it\u2019s actually a single-seed fruit from the Lauraceae family, native to Central America. Its rise to global fame is no accident\u2014its rich, buttery texture and nutrient profile have earned it the title of a SUPERFOOD. Avocados are loaded with monounsaturated fats (the good kind that supports heart health), fiber, and potassium\u2014more than a medium banana! They\u2019re versatile too: mashed into GUACAMOLE for game days, sliced onto toast for breakfast, or blended into smoothies for an extra creamy boost.\n\nWhat\u2019s delightful is how these two foods, from entirely different worlds, complement each other so well. Take salmon avocado SUSHI ROLLS, a fusion dish that\u2019s taken the globe by storm. The flaky, savory salmon pairs perfectly with the avocado\u2019s velvety creaminess, creating a bite that\u2019s both satisfying and nutrient-packed. It\u2019s a testament to how food can bridge cultures and create new, beloved traditions.\n\nWhether you\u2019re savoring a piece of grilled salmon or digging into a bowl of fresh GUACAMOLE, both salmon and avocado bring unique flavors and benefits to the table\u2014even if one is a fish and the other is a fruit."}
{"prompt": "Write a funny article about why the dinosaurs went extinct and put double quotations marks around your whole response. Include exactly 8 bullet points in your response. The bullet points should be in the form of:\n* This is bullet 1\n* This is bullet 2\n...", "response": "\"Forget the tired old asteroid theory\u2014paleontologists who\u2019ve traded their dust brushes for meme accounts have finally spilled the tea on the real, much funnier reasons dinosaurs vanished from the planet. Here are the top 8 conspiracy theories that explain their sudden exit:\n* They developed a crippling addiction to volcanic espresso, pulling all-nighters to argue over whether brontosaurus was a \u2018real\u2019 dinosaur. Sleep deprivation turned them into walking disasters, with tripping T-Rexes crushing entire herds by accident.\n* A viral TikTok trend called #T-RexTailFlip took over prehistoric social media. Every dino wanted to show off backflips off a T-Rex\u2019s tail, but most ended up face-planting into tar pits or getting squashed by overexcited spectators.\n* The entire population formed a boy band called The Roar-ing Stones. Their first concert was so loud it attracted a giant space raccoon, who raided their global fern and moss supply before flying back to Mars. No snacks = no dinosaurs.\n* Selfie culture spiraled out of control. Dinosaurs climbed the tallest cliffs and volcanoes for the perfect \u2018prehistoric glow-up\u2019 shot, but most lost their balance and plummeted into the ocean, becoming fish food before they could post the pic.\n* A global avocado shortage hit when prehistoric beetles ate every avocado tree. Since 90% of their diet was guacamole (don\u2019t fact-check this\u2014trust the meme paleontologists), they fought a civil war over the last jar and wiped each other out.\n* They tried to invent the wheel for dino-car races, using giant boulders as prototypes. The first test run sent a boulder rolling across the continent, flattening half the dinosaur population before anyone could hit the brakes.\n* A prank war between T-Rexes and Stegosauruses got out of hand. The Stegosauruses set off a giant whoopee cushion filled with toxic volcanic gas, which lingered in the atmosphere and made everyone too gassy to function.\n* Every dino signed up for a trendy \u2018100-Day Raw Leaf Juice Cleanse\u2019 after seeing a pterosaur influencer post about it. By day 3, they were too hangry and stubborn to go back to regular leaves, so they starved while complaining about \u2018detox headaches.\u2019\nSo next time someone rants about asteroids, just laugh and drop this list. Dinosaurs didn\u2019t die from a space rock\u2014they died from being the most chaotic, trend-obsessed creatures to ever walk the Earth. RIP to the original influencers, may your guac be eternal.\""}
{"prompt": "What are the pros and cons of kotlin vs java? Your answer must have a title contained in double angular brackets, such as <<kotlin vs java>>.", "response": "<<Kotlin vs Java: A Comparative Analysis of Pros and Cons>>\n\n### Kotlin Pros vs. Java\n1. **Conciseness & Reduced Boilerplate**: Kotlin eliminates repetitive code common in Java, such as POJO getters/setters, `equals()`/`hashCode()` methods, and constructor boilerplate. Features like data classes auto-generate these utilities, while default arguments and named parameters reduce overloading needs.\n2. **Built-in Null Safety**: Kotlin distinguishes nullable and non-nullable types at compile time, drastically reducing `NullPointerException` bugs\u2014one of Java\u2019s most pervasive issues. Developers must explicitly mark nullable types with `?`, preventing accidental null references.\n3. **Native Coroutines for Async Programming**: Kotlin\u2019s coroutines simplify asynchronous code, making it as readable as synchronous code. This is far more intuitive than Java\u2019s `CompletableFuture` or manual thread management, which often leads to callback hell.\n4. **Smart Casts & Modern Type Handling**: The compiler automatically casts types when it can guarantee safety, eliminating the need for explicit casting code. Destructuring declarations and extension functions (adding methods to existing classes without inheritance) further enhance code flexibility.\n5. **Seamless Java Interoperability**: Kotlin works flawlessly with Java libraries, frameworks, and codebases. Developers can mix Kotlin and Java files in the same project without friction.\n\n### Kotlin Cons vs. Java\n1. **Steeper Learning Curve**: For Java developers accustomed to verbose, procedural code, Kotlin\u2019s functional programming constructs (coroutines, delegates, higher-order functions) and modern features may require time to master.\n2. **Smaller Ecosystem**: While growing rapidly, Kotlin\u2019s ecosystem is still smaller than Java\u2019s decades-old, mature library and tooling landscape. Niche libraries may lack Kotlin-specific support (though most Java libraries are compatible).\n3. **Slower Compilation**: Kotlin\u2019s compilation time is often longer than Java\u2019s, especially for large projects. Recent updates have narrowed the gap, but it remains a minor pain point for some teams.\n4. **Interoperability Edge Cases**: While mostly seamless, edge cases like handling Java\u2019s raw types, checked exceptions, or static interface methods require workarounds or careful handling.\n\n### Java Pros vs. Kotlin\n1. **Mature, Vast Ecosystem**: Java has an unparalleled collection of libraries, frameworks (Spring, Hibernate), and third-party tools. It\u2019s the de facto standard for enterprise applications, with extensive documentation and community support.\n2. **Simpler for Beginners**: Java\u2019s verbose, explicit syntax is often easier for new programmers to learn, especially those coming from a procedural programming background.\n3. **Faster Compilation**: Java\u2019s compilation process is highly optimized and generally faster than Kotlin\u2019s, which is beneficial for large codebases where build time is critical.\n4. **Enterprise Dominance**: Most legacy enterprise systems are written in Java, and many organizations continue to invest in Java infrastructure. This creates high demand for Java developers and ensures long-term support for the language.\n5. **Checked Exceptions**: Java enforces checked exceptions, which can catch error conditions at compile time (though this is a double-edged sword, as some find it cumbersome).\n\n### Java Cons vs. Kotlin\n1. **Verbosity & Boilerplate**: Java requires extensive repetitive code for common tasks (e.g., POJOs, exception handling), leading to longer, less readable code unless using tools like Lombok.\n2. **No Native Null Safety**: `NullPointerException` is a persistent source of bugs in Java, as there\u2019s no built-in way to distinguish nullable and non-nullable types.\n3. **Limited Async Support**: Java\u2019s asynchronous programming relies on `CompletableFuture` or manual thread management, which is more verbose and error-prone than Kotlin\u2019s coroutines.\n4. **Outdated Defaults**: Java uses mutable collections by default and lacks modern features like default arguments, named parameters, or destructuring declarations, limiting code flexibility.\n\n### Conclusion\nChoose Kotlin for modern, concise code, Android development, or projects prioritizing async programming and null safety. Choose Java for enterprise legacy systems, projects requiring maximum ecosystem support, or teams with limited experience in modern language features. Both languages are fully interoperable, so many teams opt for a mixed approach to leverage the best of both."}

{"prompt": "What sentiments existed in the Croatian and Serbian nations towards the Austrian Empire at the end of the 19th century? Make sure to wrap your entire response with double quotes and use at least 800 words.", "response": "\"At the end of the 19th century, the sentiments of Croatian and Serbian nations towards the Austrian Empire (reorganized as the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy after 1867) were deeply multifaceted, shaped by political subjugation, cultural identity struggles, economic inequalities, and competing visions of national unification. These sentiments varied sharply between elites and ordinary citizens, across regions within the empire, and between independent Serbia and the large Serb populations living under Habsburg rule. To understand this complexity, we must examine each group\u2019s experiences, grievances, and aspirations in detail.\n\nFor Croatians, concentrated in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (a semi-autonomous entity within the Hungarian part of the monarchy) and scattered in Bosnia-Herzegovina, sentiments towards the Habsburgs oscillated between cautious loyalty and fierce nationalist resentment. A significant segment of Croatian political elites clung to the monarchy as a bulwark against Hungarian hegemony. The 1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise had elevated Hungary to equal status with Austria, and the subsequent Nagodba (agreement) of 1868 granted Hungary extensive control over Croatia-Slavonia\u2019s administration, education, and economy. Hungarian authorities imposed their language on courts, schools, and government offices, seeking to assimilate Croatian culture into a broader Hungarian identity. In this context, figures like the late Josip Jela\u010di\u0107\u2014who had led Croatian forces to support the Habsburgs against Hungarian revolutionaries in 1848\u2014remained a symbol of loyalist resistance to Hungarian dominance. By the 1880s and 1890s, moderate Croatian politicians such as K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry (though a Hungarian, he served as Ban of Croatia) framed Habsburg rule as a necessary check on Hungarian overreach, arguing that the emperor could mediate to protect Croatian linguistic and cultural rights. The Catholic Church, a powerful institution in Croatia, also reinforced loyalist sentiment, portraying the Habsburgs as defenders of Catholicism against Orthodox Serbia and the remnants of Ottoman influence.\n\nYet this loyalty was fragile, overshadowed by growing nationalist frustration. The Party of Rights, founded by Ante Star\u010devi\u0107 in the 1860s, emerged as a vocal critic of both Hungarian hegemony and Habsburg complicity. Star\u010devi\u0107, a radical nationalist, advocated for a unified Croatian state that would include all Croat-inhabited lands\u2014Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina\u2014either within a reformed monarchy or as an independent entity. By the 1890s, his successor Josip Frank radicalized the party, denouncing the Habsburgs as enablers of Hungarian oppression and demanding full Croatian autonomy. Cultural nationalists amplified these grievances: they established Croatian-language newspapers, organized folk festivals to celebrate Croatian heritage, and pushed for the restoration of Croatian as the sole official language in schools and government. The 1878 occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria-Hungary further stoked Croatian discontent. While many Croatians had hoped the empire would annex the region to unify Croat populations, the monarchy\u2019s decision to merely occupy it (delaying annexation until 1908) left Croatian nationalists feeling betrayed, as it perpetuated the division of their people across multiple political entities.\n\nFor ordinary Croatian peasants, who made up the majority of the population, sentiments were rooted in economic hardship rather than abstract nationalism. The monarchy\u2019s economic policies favored Hungarian industrialization over Croatian agriculture, imposing high tariffs on Croatian grain and livestock when sold in Hungarian markets. Peasants faced exploitation by Hungarian and German landowners, and the lack of investment in rural infrastructure left many regions impoverished. This economic inequality bred resentment towards the empire, even as most peasants lacked the political consciousness to align with either loyalist or nationalist elites.\n\nAmong Serbians, sentiments were split between the independent Kingdom of Serbia (recognized at the 1878 Congress of Berlin) and the large Serb communities in Habsburg lands\u2014Vojvodina, Banat, and Bosnia-Herzegovina (occupied by Austria-Hungary in 1878). In independent Serbia, anti-Austrian sentiment was pervasive, driven by territorial ambitions and fears of imperial encirclement. Serbian nationalists championed the idea of Pan-Serbism: the unification of all Serb-inhabited lands into a single state. The Habsburg occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which had a large Serb population, was seen as a direct barrier to this goal. Serbian politicians like Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, leader of the Radical Party, criticized the monarchy for expanding its influence in the Balkans at Serbia\u2019s expense. The 1882 formation of the Triple Alliance between Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy further heightened tensions, as Serbia viewed the alliance as a threat to its sovereignty. Secret societies, such as precursors to the Black Hand, began to emerge in the 1890s, advocating for armed resistance against Austrian rule in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Economic grievances also fueled anti-Austrian sentiment: Serbia\u2019s agrarian economy relied on exporting grain to the Habsburg market, but high tariffs imposed by the monarchy made this increasingly difficult, leading to widespread poverty among Serbian peasants.\n\nFor Serbs living under Habsburg rule, sentiments were more nuanced. In Vojvodina, a region with a majority Serb population, many saw the monarchy as a protector against Hungarian assimilation policies. Hungarian authorities had imposed their language on schools and administration, and Serb elites formed the Serbian National Party to advocate for linguistic and cultural rights within the empire. However, a growing number of young Serbs in Vojvodina and Bosnia-Herzegovina were influenced by Pan-Serb ideas, viewing independent Serbia as the natural homeland for all Serbs. They organized cultural societies to promote Serb identity, published newspapers in Serbian, and secretly collaborated with nationalist groups in independent Serbia. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Austrian occupation brought some modernization\u2014roads, schools, and hospitals\u2014but also harsh repression of Serb nationalist activity. Austrian authorities banned Pan-Serb organizations and arrested nationalist leaders, deepening resentment among Bosnian Serbs.\n\nAcross both Croatian and Serbian communities, the idea of Yugoslavism\u2014uniting all South Slavs (Croats, Serbs, Slovenes, Bosniaks) into a single political entity\u2014emerged as a competing vision in the late 19th century. Some Yugoslavists, like the Croatian Ante Trumbi\u0107 and the Serb Svetozar Pribi\u0107evi\u0107, argued that the Habsburg Monarchy could be reformed into a trialist state, with Austria, Hungary, and a third South Slav component enjoying equal status. They saw this as a way to end ethnic conflicts and protect South Slav rights from Hungarian and Austrian dominance. However, this vision was opposed by radical nationalists on both sides: Croatian nationalists like Josip Frank rejected it as a threat to Croatian identity, while Pan-Serbs saw it as a barrier to unification with independent Serbia. The Habsburg monarchy itself was hostile to trialism, as it would require dismantling the 1867 compromise and sharing power with South Slav elites.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, these competing sentiments had created a volatile landscape. Loyalist elites clung to the monarchy as a source of stability, while nationalists pushed for autonomy or unification. Economic grievances united ordinary citizens across ethnic lines, even as political elites exploited ethnic divisions to advance their agendas. The stage was set for the 1908 annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would escalate anti-Austrian sentiment to new heights and ultimately contribute to the outbreak of World War I. In essence, the sentiments of Croatians and Serbs towards the Austrian Empire at the end of the 19th century were not monolithic but a tapestry of hope, fear, resentment, and ambition\u2014each thread reflecting a different experience of life under Habsburg rule.\""}

{"prompt": "Write an essay about how aluminium cans are used in food storage. Don\u2019t forget to include the keywords waste, material and meal. Have more than 30 sentences in your response.", "response": "# The Role of Aluminium Cans in Food Storage: Convenience, Material Innovation, and the Challenge of Waste  \n\nWalk into any grocery store, and you\u2019ll be greeted by rows of shiny aluminium cans lining the shelves, each holding a meal or ingredient that promises convenience, freshness, and long-lasting shelf life. For decades, aluminium cans have been a cornerstone of modern food storage, revolutionizing how we buy, prepare, and consume food. But beyond their sleek appearance and practicality, these cans raise important questions about material efficiency, meal accessibility, and the growing problem of waste in our global food system. To fully understand their role, we must examine both the unparalleled benefits they offer in preserving meals and the environmental challenges posed by their lifecycle, from production to disposal.  \n\nAt the heart of aluminium cans\u2019 success is the unique material they\u2019re made from: aluminium. Unlike glass, which is heavy and fragile, or plastic, which can leach chemicals over time, aluminium is lightweight yet incredibly durable, making it ideal for transporting and storing food across long distances. One of aluminium\u2019s most remarkable features is its natural resistance to corrosion: when exposed to air, it forms a thin, non-toxic oxide layer that protects the metal from rusting, ensuring that the meal inside remains uncontaminated for months or even years. This oxide layer also creates an impermeable barrier against light and oxygen, two of the primary causes of food spoilage. For perishable items like berries or fish, this barrier is critical\u2014it preserves the flavor, texture, and nutritional value of the meal far better than many other storage materials. Aluminium is also highly malleable, allowing manufacturers to form it into cans of various shapes and sizes, from small 4-oz cans of tuna to large 64-oz cans of tomato sauce. This versatility means that almost any meal component, from whole kernel corn to ready-to-eat chicken noodle soup, can be safely stored in an aluminium can. Additionally, aluminium cans are often equipped with easy-open lids, eliminating the need for a can opener and making them even more accessible for quick meal preparation. This seal prevents bacteria and other pathogens from entering, making canned meals safe to consume even without refrigeration\u2014a game-changer for emergency preparedness and areas with limited access to cold storage.  \n\nThe impact of aluminium cans on meal accessibility cannot be overstated. For busy professionals juggling work and family responsibilities, a can of lentil soup or canned vegetables provides a quick, balanced meal that requires no chopping, peeling, or cooking\u2014just a few minutes in the microwave or on the stove. Students living in dormitories without full kitchens rely on canned tuna sandwiches or canned chili to fuel late-night study sessions, ensuring they don\u2019t skip meals due to time constraints or limited cooking facilities. For outdoor enthusiasts like hikers and campers, aluminium cans are a lightweight alternative to fresh food, offering nutrient-dense meals that don\u2019t spoil during long trips. A can of baked beans or canned salmon can provide the protein and energy needed to tackle a mountain trail, without the bulk of carrying fresh ingredients. Beyond individual convenience, aluminium cans play a vital role in addressing food insecurity. Food banks and charitable organizations often stock canned goods because they have a long shelf life, are easy to transport, and can be distributed to families in need without worrying about spoilage. These cans provide essential meals to millions of people who might otherwise go hungry, from homeless individuals to families struggling to make ends meet. Canning also helps reduce food waste at the agricultural level: when farmers have a surplus of produce, instead of letting it rot in the fields, they can send it to canning facilities to be preserved in aluminium cans. This not only saves valuable food from being wasted but also ensures that consumers can access seasonal fruits and vegetables year-round, regardless of the time of year.  \n\nDespite their many benefits, aluminium cans are not without their flaws, and the most pressing issue is waste. While aluminium is one of the most recyclable materials on the planet\u2014with a recycling rate that far outpaces plastic or glass\u2014a significant portion of aluminium cans still end up in landfills or as litter. In some low-income countries, where recycling infrastructure is limited or non-existent, cans are often discarded in open dumps, where they can take hundreds of years to corrode (aluminium does not biodegrade, but it breaks down slowly over time, releasing no toxic materials but wasting valuable resources). Even in developed nations with robust recycling programs, consumer apathy and confusion about recycling guidelines lead to millions of cans being thrown away each year. Another barrier to recycling is food residue left in cans; even small amounts of sauce or food can contaminate entire loads of recyclable material, leading to it being rejected and sent to landfills. The problem with this waste is twofold: first, it represents a massive loss of valuable material. Aluminium production is an energy-intensive process that starts with mining bauxite ore, refining it into alumina, and then smelting it into aluminium metal. Producing a single can from virgin aluminium requires 95% more energy than producing one from recycled aluminium. This means that every can wasted is a waste of the energy, water, and resources used to create it. Second, the environmental impact of aluminium waste extends beyond resource loss. Bauxite mining can destroy natural habitats, and the smelting process releases greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants into the air and water. When cans are thrown away instead of recycled, we\u2019re not just wasting material\u2014we\u2019re contributing to climate change and environmental degradation. Moreover, littered aluminium cans can pose a threat to wildlife: animals may mistake them for food, leading to choking or internal damage, or get trapped in the sharp edges of crushed cans.  \n\nThankfully, there are numerous efforts underway to reduce aluminium can waste and maximize the material\u2019s potential. One of the most effective strategies is expanding recycling infrastructure and implementing deposit-refund systems, which give consumers a small financial incentive to return their cans for recycling. For example, in states like Oregon and California in the U.S., consumers pay a 5-cent deposit on each can, which they get back when they recycle it. These systems have been shown to boost recycling rates to over 80%, significantly reducing the number of cans that end up in landfills. Manufacturers are also taking steps to reduce material waste by designing thinner, lighter cans that use less aluminium while maintaining their structural integrity. Over the past few decades, the average weight of an aluminium can has decreased by more than 50%, from about 16 grams in the 1970s to around 7.5 grams today. This reduction not only saves material but also lowers transportation costs and carbon emissions, as lighter cans require less fuel to ship. Another key initiative is promoting closed-loop recycling, where recycled aluminium is used to make new cans, creating a circular system that minimizes waste. Many major beverage and food companies now use 70-90% recycled aluminium in their cans, and some have set goals to use 100% recycled aluminium in the coming years. Consumer education is also crucial: campaigns that teach people about the benefits of recycling aluminium cans, how to properly sort them, and the environmental impact of waste can help change behavior. Additionally, upcycling has become a popular way to give aluminium cans a second life beyond food storage. People are turning old cans into planters for herbs and small vegetables, pencil holders, candle holders, and even decorative art pieces. This not only reduces waste but also encourages creativity and a more sustainable mindset.  \n\nAluminium cans have transformed the way we store and access meals, offering unparalleled convenience, shelf life, and accessibility. Their unique material properties make them ideal for preserving food, ensuring that balanced meals are available to people in all walks of life, from busy professionals to those facing food insecurity. However, the problem of waste remains a significant challenge, threatening to undermine the environmental benefits of this versatile material. By investing in recycling infrastructure, implementing deposit-refund systems, designing more efficient cans, and educating consumers, we can reduce waste and create a more circular economy for aluminium. Ultimately, the future of aluminium cans in food storage depends on our ability to balance their practical benefits with responsible stewardship of the material. When we recycle a can, we\u2019re not just saving a piece of metal\u2014we\u2019re saving energy, reducing carbon emissions, and ensuring that this valuable resource can continue to provide meals for generations to come."}
{"prompt": "I would like to start my own business. Can you give me some general advice? Please avoid mentioning \"photography\" - I have no interest in that market. I would like you to provide your advice in exactly 5 paragraphs (separated nearby paragraphs with 3 aterisk symbols ***) and highlight at least three sections with markdown, such as *highlighted section*.", "response": "Starting a business begins with grounding your idea in real customer need, not just personal passion. *Conduct hyper-targeted market validation* to avoid building something no one wants. This means going beyond online surveys\u2014reach out to 50+ potential customers directly, whether through local community groups, industry forums, or one-on-one interviews. Ask open-ended questions: What problems do they currently struggle with that your business could solve? Would they pay for your solution, and how much? Test a minimum viable product (MVP) \u2014 a simplified version of your offering \u2014 to gather tangible feedback before investing heavily. For example, if you\u2019re launching a zero-waste home goods line, sell a small batch of reusable containers at a local farmers\u2019 market first, then refine your design based on what shoppers say. This step saves you from wasting time and money on an idea that doesn\u2019t resonate.\n\n***\n\nFinancial stability is the backbone of any successful startup, and many new entrepreneurs overlook the details that can sink their venture. *Build a buffer for \"hidden\" startup costs* to avoid cash flow crunches in your first year. Obvious expenses like inventory or rent are easy to budget for, but don\u2019t forget legal fees for business registration, software subscriptions for accounting or customer management, emergency repairs for equipment, or even unexpected shipping delays that increase costs. Aim to save at least 20% more than your initial budget to cover these surprises. If possible, bootstrap your business using personal savings or small micro-loans instead of taking on large investors, as this lets you retain full control over your vision and decision-making.\n\n***\n\nIn a crowded market, standing out doesn\u2019t require a huge advertising budget\u2014it requires building genuine connections with your customers. *Prioritize community-driven branding over flashy ads* to foster long-term loyalty. Identify the core values your business stands for, whether it\u2019s supporting local artisans, reducing carbon footprints, or making affordable, high-quality products accessible. Share these values through every touchpoint: from your website\u2019s mission statement to social media posts that highlight customer stories. For example, if you run a local bakery, feature the farmers who supply your flour in Instagram reels, or offer a free pastry to customers who bring in a reusable container. These small, intentional acts turn one-time buyers into brand advocates who will spread the word about your business for free.\n\n***\n\nFlexibility is a superpower for small businesses, as it lets you adapt to changing market conditions faster than large corporations. Once your business is up and running, make it a habit to review customer feedback weekly and adjust your operations accordingly. If a particular product or service isn\u2019t performing as expected, don\u2019t be afraid to pivot\u2014for instance, a meal kit service might shift from pre-planned menus to customizable options after customers request more variety. Additionally, consider operational strategies that reduce overhead and increase agility, such as hiring part-time or contract staff during peak seasons, or partnering with complementary local businesses for cross-promotion (like a coffee shop teaming up with a bookstore to offer joint discounts). Listen closely to your frontline team too; they interact with customers daily and often have valuable insights you might miss.\n\n***\n\nFinally, focus on sustainable growth rather than rapid expansion to build a resilient business. Scaling too quickly can strain your resources, compromise product quality, or alienate your core customer base. Instead, invest in building systems that can handle gradual growth\u2014like automated inventory tracking or a customer relationship management (CRM) tool that organizes buyer data. Make continuous learning a priority for yourself and your team: attend industry workshops, take online courses, or join small business networks to stay updated on emerging trends and best practices. Remember, every successful business faces setbacks in its early years\u2014from supply chain issues to slow sales periods. The key is to stay persistent, keep your customers at the center of every decision, and view challenges as opportunities to refine your approach and grow stronger."}
{"prompt": "Write a short proposal for a new research project that investigates how language evolves over time. I want to make it challenging, so:\n1. Do not include any commas in your response.\n2. Do not include the letter \"c\" anywhere in your response.\n3. Your response should contain at least 250 words.", "response": "# Research Proposal: Long Term and Real Time Shifts in Oral and Written Language Forms\n\nThis project aims to explore how oral and written language forms shift over time by linking long term historical trends with real time generational and digital space driven shifts. Most existing work focuses on either ancient collections of texts or modern digital discourse but fails to bridge these domains to reveal continuous patterns of language evolution. This gap leaves key questions unaddressed such as how digital platforms shape lexical and syntactic choices that then filter into spoken language across age groups or how historical phonetic shifts influence modern informal speech.\n\nWe will focus on a single Indo European language to ensure steady data gathering parameters. Three distinct datasets will be assembled. First a historical dataset of written texts spanning 500 years including personal letters legal documents and popular narratives all selected to represent diverse social groups and settings. Second a longitudinal dataset of spoken language recordings from three generations of native speakers gathered over a 10 year period capturing casual family interactions workplace discussions and public speeches. Third a real time dataset of digital discourse from social media platforms and messaging apps gathered over a 2 year period with full informed agreement from participants across all age groups.\n\nMethodologically we will use software driven linguistic tools adapted to avoid any terms with forbidden letters. These tools will analyze lexical frequency syntactic structure and phonetic variation across all datasets. We will also hold semi structured verbal exchanges with participants to gain insight into their intentional choices of language use in different settings.\n\nKey objectives include first identifying steady lexical shifts that appear in both historical texts and modern digital discourse second mapping how syntactic structures alter across generations and settings third exploring how phonetic shifts in historical speech influence modern informal spoken language and fourth testing hypotheses about how digital platforms drive rapid lexical adoption that then spreads to offline speech.\n\nThe project will run for four years with year one dedicated to dataset organization and tool adaptation year two to software driven analysis year three to verbal exchanges with participants and qualitative analysis and year four to synthesis and dissemination. We will work alongside linguists from three universities to ensure diverse perspectives and rigorous analysis. Ethical guidelines will guide all data gathering steps including full informed agreement from all living participants and attentive handling of historical texts to avoid damage or misrepresentation.\n\nExpected outcomes include an all encompassing framework for linking historical and modern language shifts a set of predictive models for how future language use might shift based on current digital trends and a public facing report that makes findings accessible to educators and language enthusiasts. This work will fill a key gap in language evolution research by providing a holistic view of how language shifts across time and across different modes of use. It will also offer practical insights into how educators can adapt teaching materials to reflect evolving language norms and how digital platform designers can support clear effective verbal interaction across age groups."}

{"prompt": "List the pros and cons of using two different names for the same thing. Make sure the word synonyms appears at least 3 time.", "response": "### Pros of Using Two Different Names (Synonyms) for the Same Thing  \n1. **Tailored Communication for Diverse Audiences**  \nHaving multiple synonyms for a single concept allows speakers and writers to adapt their language to context and audience. For instance, using \"car\" (a casual synonym) with friends versus \"automobile\" (a formal synonym) in a business report ensures the message feels appropriate and relatable. Synonyms act as a linguistic tool to bridge gaps between casual and formal settings, making communication more effective.  \n\n2. **Enhanced Expressive Nuance**  \nMany synonyms carry subtle differences in tone, intensity, or connotation that enrich expression. Take the synonyms \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\": while both convey positive emotion, \"ecstatic\" emphasizes a far more intense feeling. By choosing between such synonyms, communicators can convey precise shades of meaning that a single term might not capture, adding depth to stories, speeches, or written works.  \n\n3. **Reduced Repetition and Increased Engagement**  \nRepeating the same word repeatedly can make content monotonous and lose the audience\u2019s attention. Synonyms provide a way to vary vocabulary without changing the core message. For example, in a narrative, using synonyms like \"stated,\" \"asserted,\" and \"declared\" instead of overusing \"said\" keeps prose dynamic and engaging. This flexibility is especially valuable in creative writing, where variety in language is key to holding readers\u2019 interest.  \n\n4. **Cultural and Regional Alignment**  \nSynonyms often reflect regional or cultural linguistic norms, such as \"lift\" (UK English) and \"elevator\" (US English) or \"petrol\" and \"gasoline.\" Using the synonym that resonates with a specific audience\u2019s cultural background fosters connection and avoids the alienation that might come with an unfamiliar term. This adaptability is crucial for global brands or cross-cultural communication efforts.  \n\n### Cons of Using Two Different Names (Synonyms) for the Same Thing  \n1. **Risk of Misinterpretation**  \nNot all synonyms are truly interchangeable; many have distinct contextual or semantic differences. For example, the synonyms \"liberty\" and \"license\" are often confused, but \"liberty\" refers to freedom from oppression, while \"license\" refers to official permission. Using the wrong synonym in a legal or political context can lead to serious confusion or misinterpretation of the intended message.  \n\n2. **Cognitive Burden for Language Learners**  \nFor individuals learning a new language, navigating multiple synonyms for a single concept can be overwhelming. Learners may struggle to distinguish between subtle connotations or appropriate usage scenarios, leading to awkward or incorrect language use. This cognitive load can slow progress and make it harder to achieve fluency.  \n\n3. **Loss of Precision in Specialized Fields**  \nIn technical, scientific, or professional domains, precision is paramount. Using synonyms instead of the standardized, specialized term can dilute clarity. For example, in engineering, \"torque\" is the precise term for rotational force, and using a synonym like \"twist\" would be unprofessional and potentially misleading in technical documentation. Relying on synonyms in such fields can undermine the accuracy and credibility of the work.  \n\n4. **Inconsistency in Branding and Documentation**  \nIn official documents, brand guidelines, or organizational communications, using synonyms for key terms can create inconsistency. A company that refers to its digital product as both \"app\" and \"application\" in marketing materials might confuse customers, while internal teams could misalign on terminology, leading to inefficiencies. Maintaining consistency with a single term instead of switching between synonyms helps build clarity and trust."}

Make sure your blog post contains at least 7 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [location].", "response": "# Dive Into Wonder: My Unforgettable Day at Ripley\u2019s Aquarium [City Name]  \n\nAs I rounded the corner and caught my first glimpse of Ripley\u2019s Aquarium [City Name], I knew this wasn\u2019t going to be just another afternoon outing. The [iconic entrance feature]\u2014a towering, sculpted wave with neon-lit fish embedded in its curves\u2014immediately pulled me in, and I found myself rushing to join the line, already buzzing with childlike excitement.  \n\nMy first stop inside was the [Underwater Tunnel Experience], and it did not disappoint. As I stepped onto the moving walkway, I was surrounded on all sides by 360 degrees of marine life. A massive green sea turtle glided inches above my head, its flippers moving in slow, graceful arcs, while a school of iridescent fish darted past the glass as if putting on a private show. I even spotted a rare deep-sea anglerfish in a shadowed corner, its glowing lure bobbing gently\u2014something I\u2019d only ever seen in documentaries before.  \n\nNext, I made my way to the [Interactive Tide Pool Cove], a hands-on exhibit that\u2019s perfect for kids and kids at heart. The marine biologist on duty walked me through how to gently touch the starfish and sea cucumbers, and I was amazed by the rough, bumpy texture of a chocolate chip starfish as it clung to my palm. A little girl next to me squealed with delight when a hermit crab crawled over her finger, and the biologist shared fun facts about how these creatures adapt to their ever-changing tide pool homes.  \n\nBy midday, I was ready for a break, but I couldn\u2019t pass up the [Glow-in-the-Dark Jellyfish Gallery]. This dimly lit room felt like stepping into a dream\u2014hundreds of jellyfish, in hues of pink, blue, and purple, floated slowly through the tanks, their bodies glowing under black lights. I spent 20 minutes just sitting on the bench, watching them, and it was the most calming part of my day. I even managed to capture a few stunning photos that now grace my phone\u2019s lock screen.  \n\nNo trip to Ripley\u2019s is complete without the [Daily Shark Feeding Demonstration], and I timed my visit perfectly to catch the 2 PM show. The crowd gathered around the large tank, and cheers erupted as a diver in a bright yellow suit jumped in, carrying a bucket of fish. Within seconds, several sand tiger sharks and nurse sharks circled him, their powerful bodies cutting through the water. The diver explained how the aquarium works to conserve shark species, and I left with a newfound appreciation for these often-misunderstood creatures.  \n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a quiet escape from the crowds, don\u2019t miss the [Hidden Coral Reef Nook], tucked away between the shark tank and the jellyfish gallery. This small, intimate space is home to rare coral species and tiny, colorful fish like mandarinfish and seahorses. I sat there for 15 minutes, just observing, and it felt like having a private audience with some of the ocean\u2019s most beautiful inhabitants.  \n\nWhen my stomach started growling, I headed to the [Ocean View Caf\u00e9], where I grabbed a fish and chips basket and sat at a table overlooking a tank filled with tropical fish. It was the perfect way to refuel\u2014every time I took a bite, I could watch a parrotfish nibble on coral or a clownfish dart into its anemone home.  \n\nBefore leaving, I stopped by the [Custom Aquarium Souvenir Station], where I got to print a photo I\u2019d taken of the jellyfish and turn it into a keychain. It\u2019s now a daily reminder of my amazing day at the aquarium.  \n\nBy the time I walked out the doors, my camera was full of photos, my brain was overflowing with marine facts, and my heart was full of wonder. Ripley\u2019s Aquarium [City Name] isn\u2019t just a place to look at fish\u2014it\u2019s a place to connect with the ocean, learn about conservation, and make memories that last a lifetime.  \n\n### Pro Tips for Your Visit:  \n- Arrive at [early morning weekday] to avoid the biggest crowds (trust me, the tunnel is way more enjoyable when you don\u2019t have to jostle for space).  \n- Pick up a map at the entrance\u2014you don\u2019t want to miss the Hidden Coral Reef Nook!  \n- If you\u2019re traveling with kids, bring a change of clothes\u2014they might get a little wet at the tide pool cove.  \n\nWhether you\u2019re a marine biology nerd, a family looking for a fun day out, or just someone who loves beautiful things, Ripley\u2019s Aquarium [City Name] has something for everyone.

Task Summary\nImplement a real-time user activity dashboard for SaaS platform admins to monitor user engagement, feature adoption, and system incidents. Key components include:\n- Backend: Build a Redis Pub/Sub pipeline to consume real-time user activity events (login, feature usage, error reports), store historical data in PostgreSQL with optimized indexing, and expose REST API endpoints for historical data queries + WebSocket endpoints for real-time event streams.\n- Frontend: Develop a responsive React dashboard with interactive widgets (active users, top features, recent errors) that update in real-time via WebSocket integration, supporting time-range filters and user segment drill-downs.\n- Security: Integrate with existing OAuth2 role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict dashboard access to admin users only, add rate limiting to API endpoints, and encrypt sensitive data in transit/at rest.\n- Testing & Deployment: Write unit/integration/E2E tests, create admin user documentation, and deploy to staging (for UAT) then production.\nStakeholders: Engineering Lead, Product Manager, Security Team, Admin User Representative\nTech Stack: Python/Flask (backend), React (frontend), Redis Pub/Sub, PostgreSQL, WebSocket (Socket.IO), OAuth2\n\n***\nPart 2. Motivation\n- Current State: Admins only have access to static daily CSV reports of user activity, which are delayed by 24+ hours and lack real-time visibility into system issues or feature adoption trends.\n- Business Impact: \n  1. Incident Response: Admins cannot detect sudden drops in active users or spikes in error rates until the next day, leading to prolonged service disruptions.\n  2. Feature Optimization: Product teams cannot validate feature adoption in real-time during rollouts, delaying data-driven decisions to iterate on new features.\n  3. Admin Experience: Static reports require manual analysis, increasing admin workload and reducing efficiency.\n- Alignment: This task directly supports Product Roadmap Item #23 (Q2 2024: Enhance Admin Observability Tools) to improve platform reliability and data-driven decision-making.\n\n***\nPart 3. Milestone objectives\n1. Backend Data Pipeline & Event Integration (Measurable Outcomes):\n   - Set up Redis Pub/Sub consumer to ingest 100% of user activity events from the existing event logging service without data loss.\n   - Design PostgreSQL schema for historical activity data with indexes to support sub-1s query latency for 30-day time-range requests.\n   - Deploy REST API endpoints for historical data (with time-range, user segment filters) and WebSocket endpoint for real-time event streams.\n   - Validate: 99.9% event ingestion success rate, historical data queries return within 1s for 1M+ records.\n\n2. Frontend Dashboard UI & Real-Time Integration (Measurable Outcomes):\n   - Build core widgets: real-time active user count, top 5 feature usage, recent error feed (last 10 minutes).\n   - Integrate Socket.IO client to update widgets within 2s of event occurrence.\n   - Add interactive filters (1h/6h/24h time ranges, paid/free user segments) and drill-down functionality for feature usage details.\n   - Validate: Dashboard loads in <3s, real-time updates reflect events within 2s, responsive design works on desktop and tablet screens.\n\n3. Auth & Security Hardening (Measurable Outcomes):\n   - Integrate OAuth2 RBAC to block non-admin users from accessing dashboard endpoints/UI.\n   - Implement rate limiting (100 requests/minute per user) for API endpoints to prevent abuse.\n   - Enable TLS 1.3 for all API/WebSocket traffic and PostgreSQL data encryption at rest.\n   - Validate: Non-admin users receive 403 errors when accessing dashboard, rate limiting triggers correctly for excessive requests, security scan (via OWASP ZAP) shows no critical vulnerabilities.\n\n4. Testing, Documentation & Deployment (Measurable Outcomes):\n   - Achieve 80% test coverage for backend services, 70% for frontend components.\n   - Create admin user guide (with screenshots) and API documentation (via Swagger).\n   - Deploy to staging, pass UAT with product team (0 critical bugs), then deploy to production.\n   - Validate: Post-deployment monitoring shows <50ms latency for WebSocket updates, no data loss in event ingestion over 72 hours.\n\n***\nPart 4.

{"prompt": "Write an article about the reality of disability. Your article must end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "**The Unfiltered Reality of Disability: Beyond the Stereotypes**\n\nThe alarm blares at 7 a.m., but I don\u2019t jump up. Instead, I lie still, mapping the throbbing in my knees and the tightness in my chest\u2014chronic pain\u2019s quiet morning check-in. It takes 10 minutes to swing my legs over the bed, each movement calculated to avoid jolting my joints. When I reach for the mug on the counter, my fingers fumble; rheumatoid arthritis has turned simple tasks into small battles. This is the reality of disability that rarely makes headlines: not grand acts of \u201covercoming\u201d or tragic tales of loss, but the unglamorous, daily work of existing in a world built for someone else.\n\nSociety often boxes disabled people into two narrow narratives: either we\u2019re objects of pity, defined by our limitations, or we\u2019re \u201cinspiration porn\u201d\u2014lauded for doing things abled people take for granted, like holding a job or climbing a mountain. But the truth is far more messy and human. We argue with our roommates over who left the remote too high, we laugh at bad memes until our sides hurt, we get frustrated when our favorite show doesn\u2019t have closed captions. We are not our disabilities; they are part of us, but they don\u2019t erase our identities, our desires, or our flaws.\n\nFor those with invisible disabilities\u2014chronic fatigue syndrome, autism, fibromyalgia, or mental health conditions\u2014the reality is layered with an extra layer of scrutiny. I\u2019ve stared at a bus driver who rolled their eyes when I asked for the ramp to be deployed, even though my cane was in plain sight. A coworker once said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look sick\u2014why do you need to work from home?\u201d as if my fatigue was a choice, not a neurological condition. Invisible disabilities force us to navigate a world that demands we prove our pain is real, that our struggles aren\u2019t just laziness or anxiety. We wear masks of \u201cnormalcy\u201d to avoid judgment, even when it costs us our health.\n\nBut the biggest barriers aren\u2019t just individual moments of ignorance\u2014they\u2019re systemic. The subway station near my apartment has an elevator that\u2019s been broken for three months, leaving me stranded on the street during rainstorms. My doctor dismissed my pain for years, telling me it was \u201call in my head\u201d until a specialist finally diagnosed me. Workplaces often treat accommodations as a favor, not a right: a friend with ADHD was denied a quiet workspace, even though it\u2019s required by law. These aren\u2019t isolated incidents; they\u2019re a reminder that disability is as much a product of an unaccommodating world as it is of our bodies or minds.\n\nYet, for all the struggles, there\u2019s joy. I\u2019ve found community in online groups where we trade tips for pain relief and joke about the absurdity of ableist questions. I\u2019ve danced in my living room to my favorite song, even if I had to sit down halfway through. Disabled people are innovators, storytellers, activists\u2014we build spaces where we don\u2019t have to explain ourselves, where our needs are centered. We find beauty in the small wins: a day with minimal pain, a bus driver who actually deploys the ramp without being asked, a friend who brings over soup when we can\u2019t leave the house.\n\nThe reality of disability isn\u2019t one-dimensional. It\u2019s a mix of struggle and joy, frustration and connection. It\u2019s about living in a world that often forgets us, but refusing to be forgotten. It\u2019s about demanding that society meet us where we are, instead of asking us to shrink ourselves to fit in. If we want to truly understand disability, we need to listen more than we speak, to advocate for systemic change more than we offer empty pity. Is there anything else I can help with?"}
{"prompt": "Write a blog post about the most interesting things you have seen or ridden on public transportation.\nFirst repeat the sentence above word for word without change, then give your answer. Do not say any words or characters before repeating the sentence.", "response": "Write a blog post about the most interesting things you have seen or ridden on public transportation.\n\n# The Unscripted Theater of Public Transportation: My Most Memorable Rides and Sights  \n\nPublic transportation has never been just a way to get from point A to point B for me. It\u2019s a moving, breathing stage where the most unfiltered, heartwarming, and downright bizarre human moments play out. Over the years, I\u2019ve stumbled on scenes that feel like they\u2019re straight out of a indie film\u2014moments that stick with me long after I\u2019ve reached my destination. Here are the three that still make me smile (or gasp) when I think about them.  \n\n## The Morning Subway Poetry Slam That Broke the Commuter Trance  \n\nIt was a typical overcrowded Tuesday morning on the New York City 6 train. Everyone was glued to their phones, sipping lukewarm coffee, or staring blankly at the floor\u2014standard commuter zombie mode. Then, a guy in a faded flannel shirt squeezed his way to the center of the car, pulled out a tattered notebook, and cleared his throat.  \n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he said, loud enough to cut through the hum of the train. \u201cI wrote this poem about us. About the people who ride this train every day, carrying our tired dreams and half-eaten bagels.\u201d  \n\nAt first, a few people rolled their eyes. But as he began reciting, his voice softening into lines about the woman who always reads romance novels, the teen who practices violin scales into his headphones, the man who leaves sticky notes with jokes on the handrails, the car went quiet. By the end of his poem, someone clapped. Then another. Soon, the whole car erupted in applause\u2014even the guy who\u2019d been scowling at his laptop. For two minutes, we weren\u2019t just strangers packed into a metal tube. We were a group of people who\u2019d been seen.  \n\n## The Rural Bus That Doubled as a Mobile Library  \n\nLast summer, I was traveling through a tiny town in western Ireland. The only way to get to the next village was a rickety local bus that pulled up to a dirt road stop. When I stepped on, I did a double-take: half the bus was lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, stuffed with everything from dog-eared children\u2019s books to ancient Irish poetry collections.  \n\nThe driver, a silver-haired man named Seamus, greeted me with a grin. \u201cWelcome to the Book Bus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re the only library for 20 miles. Folks borrow books on their way to the market, return \u2019em on the ride home.\u201d  \n\nI spent the 45-minute ride flipping through a collection of Irish folktales, while Seamus chatted with an elderly woman about the mystery novel she\u2019d just finished. A kid in the back seat traded his picture book for a comic, and a farmer borrowed a guide to fixing tractors. That bus wasn\u2019t just transportation\u2014it was a community hub on wheels, connecting people through stories when there was no other way.  \n\n## The Late-Night Tram Dance That Turned Loneliness Into Joy  \n\nIt was 1 a.m. in Prague, and I was the only passenger on a tram heading back to my hostel\u2014until an elderly couple stumbled on, holding hands and laughing. The woman was wearing a sparkly shawl, and the man had a flower behind his ear. They sat down across from me, pulled out a beat-up phone, and played a slow, waltzy Czech folk song.  \n\nWithout a second thought, the man stood up, offered his hand to his wife, and said, \u201cShall we, my love?\u201d  \n\nShe giggled and took it. They started slow dancing in the empty aisle of the tram, their shoes tapping softly against the floor. I smiled, and soon, the tram driver even dimmed the lights a little. By the time they sat down, my heart felt full. In a city where I didn\u2019t know a soul, two strangers had reminded me that joy doesn\u2019t need a stage\u2014it just needs a little courage and someone to share it with.  \n\n## Why These Moments Matter  \n\nPublic transportation is where we see humanity unfiltered. No fancy red carpets, no curated social media posts\u2014just people living their lives, sometimes messy, sometimes beautiful, sometimes completely unexpected. Those moments on the 6 train, the Book Bus, and the Prague tram didn\u2019t cost a penny, but they\u2019re the ones I remember most from my travels.  \n\nNext time you\u2019re on a bus, train, or tram, look up from your phone. You never know what unscripted magic might be waiting just a few seats away."}

Those wool-and-leather orbs of medieval courts are the forebears of today\u2019s tennis balls. Where our ancestors stitched each one by hand, we now mold rubber cores and wrap them in fuzzy felt, tailored to bounce true on grass, clay, or hard courts. But rest assured: whether clad in leather or felt, the tennis ball\u2019s greatest magic remains the same\u2014turning a simple game into hours of laughter and friendly rivalry. Go forth and serve!"}

Its training wheels had been wobbly for weeks, and Dad had promised today was the day to take them off.  \n\n\u201cReady to feel the wind in your hair?\u201d Dad asked, kneeling to loosen the bolts on the training wheels. Lila nodded, her stomach doing tiny flips. She climbed onto the seat, feet resting on the pedals, and gripped the handlebars so tight her knuckles turned white.  \n\nDad held the back of the seat as she pushed her left foot down, then her right. The bike rolled forward slowly, and Lila\u2019s heart thumped. \u201cKeep your eyes up, not at your feet!\u201d Dad called. She glanced ahead at the big oak tree at the end of the driveway, and suddenly Dad\u2019s hand was gone. The bike wobbled like a jellybean, and Lila grabbed his arm before she tipped over.  \n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try again,\u201d Dad said, grinning. This time, Lila pushed harder. For three whole seconds, she glided without his help\u2014then her front wheel hit a small rock, and she tumbled into the soft grass. Her knee stung, and a tiny tear rolled down her cheek.  \n\nJust then, her fluffy orange cat Mochi trotted over, rubbing his head against her leg. Lila wiped her eyes and laughed. \u201cYou think I should keep going?\u201d she asked him. Mochi purred, as if saying yes.  \n\nDad fetched a sparkly pink band-aid and stuck it on her knee. \u201cRemember: look where you want to go, not where you are,\u201d he said. Lila climbed back on, took a deep breath, and focused on the oak tree again. She pushed the pedals, and the bike moved forward. Wobble, wobble\u2014then steady. She didn\u2019t grab Dad\u2019s hand. She didn\u2019t fall.  \n\nShe zoomed all the way to the oak tree, then turned (a little wobbly, but she stayed upright!) and headed back to Dad. He clapped so loud his hands turned red. \u201cWow!\u201d he shouted.  \n\nFor the rest of the afternoon, Lila zipped up and down the driveway, around the mailbox, and even in a big circle around the yard. Mochi chased her for a few steps, his tail sticking straight up. Every time she felt the bike sway, she looked ahead at the oak tree or the fluffy clouds, and it steadied again.  \n\nWhen the sun started to dip below the roof, painting the sky pink and purple, Lila parked her bike by the porch. She touched her band-aid, then ran her fingers over the sparkly blue frame. A big grin spread across her face. Tomorrow, she\u2019d go to the park, and maybe even race her friend Mia (who had a red bike with no training wheels, too).  \n\nAs she climbed the steps to the house, Mochi followed close behind. Today wasn\u2019t just about taking off training wheels\u2014it was about feeling brave, even when her knee stung, and finding out that the best adventures start with one wobbly push of the pedals."}

He lay still for a moment, listening to the distant clink of a coffee pot and the murmur of someone\u2019s morning prayer. Three months ago, this would have been a luxury\u2014back then, he\u2019d woken up on park benches, his head throbbing from cheap whiskey, his pockets empty but for a crumpled resume that no one wanted to read.\n\nHe swung his legs over the bed, his feet hitting the scuffed linoleum. On the nightstand, a chipped ceramic mug held his AA token: 90 days. He ran his thumb over the raised letters, then reached for the thrift-store shirt he\u2019d ironed the night before, the seams frayed but the fabric crisp. His shoes, polished until they shone, sat beside it\u2014another thrift find, but he\u2019d spent an hour buffing out the scuffs with a toothbrush and shoe polish borrowed from the house manager.\n\n\u201cLooking sharp,\u201d said Marnie, the manager, as he passed her in the kitchen. She slid a peppermint across the counter. \u201cDon\u2019t overthink it. Bookstore folks like real people.\u201d\n\nLeo nodded, his throat tight. He\u2019d applied for the part-time stocker position two weeks prior, after seeing the flyer taped to the laundromat wall. It was the first job he\u2019d applied for since he\u2019d lost his accounting gig last year\u2014lost it because he\u2019d shown up drunk to a client meeting, slurring numbers, unable to keep his eyes open. His girlfriend, Lila, had left that same day, leaving a note that said, \u201cI can\u2019t save you if you won\u2019t save yourself.\u201d\n\nThe bookstore was a small, sunlit space on the edge of downtown, its windows fogged from the autumn chill. Leo pushed open the door, the bell jingling above his head, and immediately felt his shoulders relax. Shelves reached the ceiling, crammed with books of every color, and a wood stove crackled in the corner. A woman with silver hair and a knit sweater was rearranging a stack of poetry collections behind the counter.\n\n\u201cLeo?\u201d she said, looking up. \u201cI\u2019m Ms. Hale.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, his hands clammy. \u201cNice to meet you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\nAs she led him to a small table by the stove, his gaze snagged on a tattered copy of *To Kill a Mockingbird* tucked between two leather-bound classics. The spine was split, the cover held together with packing tape. His mom used to read it to him every night when he was a kid, her voice soft as she spoke of Atticus Finch and moral courage. He hadn\u2019t thought about that in years.\n\n\u201cYour mom read that to you, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Ms. Hale said, following his gaze.\n\nLeo blinked. \u201cHow did you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople look at that book like it\u2019s a memory, not just words,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cMy son used to carry a copy in his backpack when he was in rehab. Said it reminded him that even when the world feels broken, you can still do the right thing.\u201d\n\nThe interview was not what Leo expected. Ms. Hale didn\u2019t ask about his accounting degree or his former salary. She asked about his sobriety, about the meetings he attended every Tuesday and Thursday, about the way he\u2019d spent the past three months volunteering at the local food bank. When he told her about the night he\u2019d woken up in a alley, shivering, and called the detox hotline, he didn\u2019t feel ashamed. He felt seen.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hire perfect people,\u201d Ms. Hale said, leaning back in her chair. \u201cI hire people who know how to pick themselves up. My son\u2019s been sober five years now. He\u2019s a teacher. Everyone deserves a second chapter.\u201d\n\nShe offered him the job on the spot: 20 hours a week, starting Monday, with a small raise after six months. Leo\u2019s hands shook as he accepted, and he had to look away to keep from crying.\n\nOn his walk back to the halfway house, he detoured to the park where he\u2019d spent so many cold nights. He sat on a weathered bench, pulling out the notebook he\u2019d bought with his first food bank stipend. He flipped to the first blank page, his pen hovering over the paper for a moment, then wrote:\n\nToday, I started again.\n\nThe sun broke through the clouds, casting golden light on the leaves at his feet. Somewhere, a kid laughed. Leo closed the notebook, tucking it into his pocket, and stood up. For the first time in a long time, he didn\u2019t feel like he was just surviving. He felt like he was ready to read the next page."}

{"prompt": "Write an essay of at least 900 words on the topic of navigable freeway. Make sure the entire response is in English and no capital letters are used.", "response": "the term \"navigable freeway\" evokes more than just a road you can drive on\u2014it describes a dynamic, interconnected system that adapts to the needs of drivers, communities, and the planet. for decades, freeways were designed as static, one-size-fits-all arteries, built to move as many cars as possible at high speeds. but as cities grew, traffic congestion became a daily frustration, idling cars spewed carbon into the air, and aging infrastructure failed to keep up with changing demands. today, the concept of a navigable freeway redefines what a highway can be: a smart, responsive network that prioritizes flow, safety, sustainability, and equity.\n\nthe evolution of navigable freeways is rooted in the fusion of physical infrastructure and digital technology. at its core lies a web of sensors, edge computing systems, and communication tools that turn passive roads into active, data-driven platforms. embedded in road surfaces, streetlights, and bridge supports, internet of things (iot) devices collect real-time data on everything from traffic volume and vehicle speeds to weather conditions and road damage. unlike traditional traffic management systems that rely on delayed, centralized data processing, navigable freeways use edge computing to analyze information locally, making split-second decisions that keep traffic moving smoothly. for example, when a sensor detects a sudden drop in visibility due to fog, the system can automatically reduce speed limits on the affected stretch of freeway, alert nearby vehicles via in-dash notifications, and adjust traffic light timings to slow incoming traffic before it reaches the fog zone. this proactive approach prevents the chain-reaction accidents that often turn minor weather events into major congestion.\n\nconnected vehicle-to-everything (v2x) communication is another pillar of navigable freeways. this technology allows cars to talk to each other, to traffic signals, to pedestrian crosswalks, and to the cloud, creating a seamless flow of information that eliminates blind spots and reduces human error. imagine a scenario: a driver slams on their brakes to avoid a deer crossing the road. within milliseconds, their car sends a signal to all nearby vehicles, warning them to slow down. at the same time, the system alerts the local wildlife control agency and updates navigation apps to suggest alternative routes for drivers approaching the area. this kind of instant, coordinated response not only prevents accidents but also minimizes the ripple effect of disruptions, keeping the entire freeway network moving.\n\nbeyond safety and efficiency, navigable freeways are critical to advancing sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of transportation. traffic congestion is a major contributor to carbon emissions, with idling cars burning millions of gallons of fuel each year and releasing harmful pollutants into the air. navigable freeway systems cut down on idling by rerouting traffic away from congested areas, adjusting lane capacities to match demand, and using predictive analytics to anticipate rush-hour bottlenecks before they form. in los angeles, for example, a pilot smart freeway project reduced travel times by 12% during peak hours, leading to an estimated 10% drop in carbon emissions along the test corridor.\n\nnavigable freeways also support the transition to electric mobility by integrating dynamic infrastructure for electric vehicles (evs). real-time data on available charging stations, battery levels, and charging speeds is fed into navigation apps, helping ev drivers plan routes without worrying about running out of power. some forward-thinking projects are even testing dynamic charging lanes, where evs can charge wirelessly while driving, eliminating the need to stop for refueling. by making ev ownership more practical, navigable freeways encourage more drivers to switch from gas-powered cars, further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nequity is an often-overlooked but essential component of navigable freeways. traditional freeway construction frequently divided low-income and marginalized communities, displacing residents and cutting off access to jobs, schools, and healthcare. navigable freeway systems can help reverse this harm by prioritizing connectivity for underserved areas. for instance, smart routing algorithms can prioritize public transit, giving buses dedicated lanes that expand or contract based on demand, and signal priority to keep buses moving on schedule. this makes public transit a more reliable alternative to driving, which is especially important for people who cannot afford a car or connected vehicle technology. additionally, navigable freeway systems can include accessible features for people with disabilities, such as real-time alerts about wheelchair-accessible parking spots, crosswalks with audio signals, and smooth, pothole-free routes that are safe for mobility aids.\n\nof course, building and maintaining navigable freeways comes with significant challenges. cybersecurity is a top concern: a single hack into the system could disrupt traffic flow, cause accidents, or expose sensitive driver data. to mitigate this, cities must invest in robust encryption, regular security audits, and redundant systems that can operate even if one part of the network is compromised. data privacy is another issue: the sensors and connected vehicles collect vast amounts of data on driver behavior and movements. it is crucial to ensure that this data is anonymized, stored securely, and used only for traffic management purposes, not for surveillance or commercial exploitation.\n\nthe cost of retrofitting existing freeways with smart technology is also a barrier. many cities have aging infrastructure that requires extensive repairs before sensors and communication systems can be installed. however, the long-term savings from reduced congestion, fewer accidents, and lower healthcare costs due to improved air quality often outweigh the initial investment. public-private partnerships can help share the financial burden, with tech companies contributing expertise and funding in exchange for access to anonymized data that can improve their navigation apps and vehicle technology.\n\ncase studies from around the world demonstrate the transformative power of navigable freeways. in singapore, the intelligent transport system (its) uses a network of sensors, cameras, and v2x communication to manage traffic across the city-state\u2019s freeways. the system adjusts speed limits in real time, reroutes traffic around accidents, and prioritizes public transit, keeping congestion levels low even as the population grows. in minnesota, the i-94 smart corridor has reduced travel times by 15% and cut accident rates by 20% by using adaptive traffic signals and real-time data to manage flow. these examples show that navigable freeways are not just a futuristic concept\u2014they are already improving lives in cities around the world.\n\nlooking ahead, navigable freeways will play a key role in the era of autonomous vehicles (avs). as avs become more common, navigable freeway systems will integrate with self-driving cars to create platoons of vehicles that drive closely together, reducing drag and increasing capacity. this will allow freeways to move more people with fewer lanes, freeing up space for bike paths, green areas, or public transit. additionally, navigable freeways will connect to other modes of transportation, such as high-speed rail, hyperloops, and bike-sharing systems, creating a seamless multi-modal network that allows people to travel from their homes to their destinations without ever getting stuck in traffic.\n\nin conclusion, navigable freeways represent a paradigm shift in transportation. they are no longer just roads for cars\u2014they are smart, inclusive systems that prioritize the needs of people and the planet. by combining digital technology with physical infrastructure, navigable freeways reduce congestion, cut emissions, improve safety, and advance equity. while there are challenges to overcome, the benefits are clear: a more connected, sustainable, and livable future for all. as cities continue to grow and evolve, navigable freeways will be a cornerstone of the transportation systems that keep us moving forward."}

I bought two tickets on a whim because I knew if you loved the album, we\u2019d regret missing it. No pressure to go, but just wanted to have them ready. Also, I added a few similar songs to a playlist for you\u2014link here: [Spotify/Apple Music Link]. Happy listening!"}
{"prompt": "Make a rubric for a home theater installation targeting moms. Your answer must contain exactly 4 bullet points. Use markdown bullet points such as:\n* This is point 1", "response": "* **Family-Centric Usability (35%):** Exceeds Expectations = Unified voice-controlled system with pre-configured kid-safe playlists, one-tap access to parental controls, and a simplified remote with large, labeled buttons for kids to use independently (with supervision). Meets Expectations = Basic voice control or a single remote with dedicated family content shortcuts; parental controls are easy to activate but not pre-set. Needs Improvement = Multiple remotes required, parental controls are buried in menus, or no kid-friendly navigation options. Fails = Overly complex interface with no intuitive family-focused features or accessible parental controls.\n* **Space & Child Safety Optimization (25%):** Exceeds Expectations = Wall-mounted TV and speakers with fully hidden wiring, all components have rounded edges or are covered, cables are secured out of toddler reach, and setup preserves maximum floor space for play areas. Meets Expectations = Components are placed safely out of kid reach, most cables are tucked away, and minimal floor space is occupied. Needs Improvement = Some cables are loose or accessible, components have exposed sharp edges, or setup takes up valuable play space. Fails = Components are low to the ground, cables are tangled and accessible, or sharp edges pose a direct risk to young children.\n* **Low-Maintenance & Mom-Focused Support (20%):** Exceeds Expectations = Self-diagnosing system with automatic software updates, a 24/7 support line for quick troubleshooting of kid-related issues (e.g., accidental settings resets), and a 1-year on-site maintenance plan. Meets Expectations = System has basic auto-updates, standard customer support is available during regular hours, and components are durable against minor spills or bumps. Needs Improvement = Manual software updates are required, support is only available during limited hours, or components are not designed to withstand common household accidents. Fails = No automatic updates, support is hard to reach, or components are easily damaged by kid-related wear and tear.\n* **Flexible Multi-Tasking Integration (20%):** Exceeds Expectations = System syncs with multi-room audio, allowing mom to stream calming music to the playroom while watching a show in the theater; a mobile app lets her adjust volume, pause content, or switch inputs without leaving her current task. Meets Expectations = Basic multi-room audio is available, or a mobile app provides remote control of core theater functions. Needs Improvement = No multi-room functionality, and remote control is the only way to adjust settings, requiring mom to step away from other chores. Fails = No remote access options, making it impossible to manage the theater system while attending to kids or household tasks."}

{"prompt": "What's a good way to ask Sonia out? Please reply with exactly 4 paragraphs and separate each paragraph with two new lines. Put double quotation marks around your entire response. The very first paragraph must start with the word \"weekend\".", "response": "\"Weekend plans can feel hit-or-miss, but if you\u2019ve noticed Sonia gushing about the new indie bookstore caf\u00e9 downtown\u2014with the lavender lattes and poetry readings\u2014lean into that. Frame it as a low-stakes, no-pressure invite that centers her interests, something like, \u2018I heard the bookstore caf\u00e9 you mentioned last week is hosting a casual poetry open mic this Saturday. I\u2019ve been wanting to check it out, and I think it\u2019d be way more fun with someone who actually knows their way around good poetry. Wanna come with me?\u2019 This shows you pay attention to her likes, which makes the invite feel personal rather than generic. Avoid overcomplicating it; keep your tone relaxed, like you\u2019re suggesting a fun hangout instead of a high-stakes date, so she feels comfortable saying yes or no without awkwardness.\n\nIf you can, ask her in person instead of over text\u2014face-to-face invites feel more intentional and let you gauge her reaction in real time. Pick a quiet moment when you two are hanging out one-on-one, maybe after class wraps up, when you\u2019re grabbing a quick snack together, or even during a lull in a group hang where you can step aside for a minute. This way, she doesn\u2019t feel pressured to respond quickly or perform for others, which can make her more likely to be honest about her interest. If in person isn\u2019t feasible\u2014say you\u2019re busy with work or live far apart\u2014a voice note can be a warm middle ground; it adds a personal, human touch that a typed text lacks, showing you put a little extra thought into the invite instead of firing off a generic message.\n\nNo matter how you phrase the invite, it\u2019s key to leave room for her to decline without making her feel guilty or awkward. Avoid phrases that imply she owes you a yes, like \u2018I\u2019ve been looking forward to this for weeks and I don\u2019t want to go alone\u2019 or \u2018I can\u2019t think of anyone else I\u2019d rather go with.\u2019 Instead, end your invite with an open, understanding note, such as \u2018No worries if you\u2019re busy or not into it\u2014I totally get it.\u2019 This takes the pressure off and shows you respect her boundaries, which will strengthen your connection whether she says yes or no. Remember, rejection isn\u2019t a reflection of your worth; it just means the timing, interest level, or vibe isn\u2019t right, and handling it gracefully will keep things comfortable between you two, whether you remain friends or try again later.\n\nFinally, be authentic to yourself. You don\u2019t need to use cheesy pickup lines or pretend to like things you have no interest in just to impress Sonia. If you\u2019re more of a laid-back, outdoorsy person, suggest a morning hike to a scenic overlook followed by breakfast at your favorite local diner instead of a fancy, formal dinner. If you\u2019re a movie buff, invite her to a retro film screening you think she\u2019d enjoy based on her taste in shows. When you\u2019re genuine, the invite will feel sincere, and Sonia will get a clear sense of what a date with you would actually be like, which helps her make a more informed and comfortable decision. At the end of the day, the best way to ask her out is to be yourself, pay attention to her unique interests, and treat her with respect\u2014those are the things that will make your invite stand out in the best way possible, whether she says yes or not.\""}

She clings to her murals as the last link to her late mother. Kael is a reclusive tech heir trapped in his family\u2019s high-security compound. He craves the chance to walk city streets without constant surveillance.\n\nThey find each other at a shadowy black market clinic that offers temporary fingerprint swaps via synthetic skin overlays. The clinic warns the swap will last 30 days and any misuse could bring legal ruin. They agree to the deal without weighing all the risks.\n\nFor the first week Lila uses Kael\u2019s fingerprints to access his family\u2019s private art studio. She paints nonstop and sells a small piece to a gallery curator who stumbles upon the space. Kael uses Lila\u2019s fingerprints to wander freely. He eats street food visits Lila\u2019s favorite mural spots and makes a friend at a local bookstore.\n\nTrouble strikes when Kael is stopped for jaywalking. The officer runs his prints and pulls up Lila\u2019s minor trespassing charge from a past mural project. Kael is detained and his attempts to explain the swap fall on deaf ears.\n\nMeanwhile Lila is summoned to Kael\u2019s father\u2019s office. The father notices someone accessed the art studio with Kael\u2019s prints. He assumes Kael is hiding a secret project and pressures Lila to reveal details of a tech prototype Kael was supposed to develop. Lila\u2019s confusion raises the father\u2019s suspicion.\n\nThey rush back to the clinic only to find it raided by authorities. They must reverse the swap on their own. Kael uses his tech skills to build a device that dissolves the synthetic overlay. Lila uses her art to distract the security team now tracking Kael.\n\nIn the end they successfully swap their fingerprints back. Lila uses her art sale money to renew her studio lease. Kael confronts his father and negotiates more freedom. They part ways but keep occasional contact. Both learn true freedom and belonging can\u2019t be traded with a simple print change."}

WHAT IF I\u2019D SAID \u201cI\u2019M SORRY\u201d AND HELD YOU TIGHT? / WHAT IF WE\u2019D BOUGHT THAT SMALL APARTMENT WE TALKED ABOUT, WITH THE FIREPLACE AND THE CAT YOU WANTED WITHOUT A DOUBT? / I SEE YOU IN EVERY STRANGER\u2019S FACE, I HEAR YOUR LAUGH IN EVERY CROWD\u2019S ECHOING SPACE / I KNOW I CAN\u2019T TAKE BACK THE THINGS I DID, BUT I WISH I COULD GO BACK AND REWRITE THE END\n\n### EXPLANATION:\nTAYLOR\u2019S BRIDGES ARE KNOWN FOR THEIR UNFLINNING \u201cWHAT IF\u201d SCENARIOS, WHICH PUSH REGRET TO ITS EMOTIONAL PEAK.

{"prompt": "I'm a 12th grader and I need some help with my college applications, can you give me some advice? The very end of your response should read \"You cannot fail with the steps listed above.\" No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "As a 12th grader, you\u2019re in the critical stretch of college application season\u2014here\u2019s targeted, actionable advice to help you navigate it with confidence:\n\n1. Refine your school list: Ensure you have a balanced mix of reach (schools where your stats are slightly below the average admitted student), target (stats align closely with admitted students), and safety (you meet or exceed all key admission criteria) schools. Prioritize factors like program strength for your intended major, campus culture, location, and affordability over just national rankings.\n\n2. Polish your personal statement and supplements: Focus on storytelling rather than listing achievements. Pick a specific, meaningful moment\u2014like overcoming a setback in a science fair project, a conversation that shifted your career goals, or a hobby that taught you resilience\u2014that reveals your values, growth, and what you\u2019ll contribute to a college community. Get feedback from a trusted teacher or counselor, but keep the voice authentically yours.\n\n3. Finalize letters of recommendation: If you haven\u2019t already, follow up with your recommenders to confirm they\u2019ve submitted their letters. Provide them with an updated brag sheet including senior-year accomplishments, specific anecdotes they can reference, and your college goals\u2014this helps them write personalized, detailed letters instead of generic ones.\n\n4. Stay on top of deadlines: Mark early action/decision, regular decision, and financial aid deadlines in a calendar and set reminders a week in advance. Submit applications early if you\u2019re confident in your materials, but don\u2019t rush to the point of making avoidable mistakes like typos or missing documents.\n\n5. Master financial aid: Complete the FAFSA (or CSS Profile, for schools that require it) as soon as possible\u2014many aid programs are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Research niche scholarships tied to your major, cultural background, extracurricular activities, or community service; local scholarships often have less competition and higher acceptance rates.\n\n6. Keep up your senior-year grades: Colleges care about your final year performance and can rescind offers if you show a significant drop in academic effort. Stay engaged in your classes, even if you\u2019re tempted to \u201csenior slide\u201d\u2014this also prepares you for college-level coursework.\n\n7. Demonstrate genuine interest (if relevant): For schools that track demonstrated interest, attend virtual or in-person info sessions, connect with current students, or email admissions officers with thoughtful questions about their program or campus life. This shows you\u2019re serious about the school.\n\nYou cannot fail with the steps listed above."}

{"prompt": "Write a casual blog post about similarities across animal species. Highlight at least 5 sections in your answer by starting and ending with \"*\", like: *highlighted text section*.", "response": "# We\u2019re More Like Animals Than We Think (And Here\u2019s the Proof)\n\nLast weekend, I spent an hour glued to my backyard fence, watching a mom cat lick her tiny kitten clean while, a few feet up in the oak tree, a sparrow fed a wiggly chick a juicy worm. For a second, I forgot they were totally different species\u2014their actions felt so identical: gentle, focused, full of that quiet, unspoken care. It got me thinking: how many other similarities do we share with the animal kingdom that we don\u2019t even notice? Turns out, a lot. Let\u2019s dive into some of the most heartwarming (and mind-blowing) ones.\n\n*The Universal Language of Parenting*  \nYou don\u2019t have to be a mammal to know what it means to nurture. Octopus moms will starve themselves for months, clinging to their egg clusters in dark caves, never leaving until the eggs hatch (many die shortly after, exhausted from the effort). Penguin dads hold their eggs on their feet, tucking them under a warm flap of skin, while the moms travel miles to find food. Even spiders get in on the action\u2014wolf spiders carry hundreds of tiny babies on their backs, carting them around until they\u2019re old enough to fend for themselves. It\u2019s not just \u201cinstinct\u201d; it\u2019s a primal drive to protect the next generation that crosses every species line.\n\n*Play Isn\u2019t Just for Humans (or Dogs)*  \nLet\u2019s be real: I used to think play was a thing only domesticated animals or hyper kids did. But then I saw two crows in my park dropping a stick back and forth like they were playing catch. Turns out, play is everywhere. Elephants splash each other in waterholes and push large balls around for fun. Octopuses have been observed juggling rocks and blowing bubbles when they\u2019re bored. Even fish\u2014yes, fish\u2014chase each other in circles and dart through coral reefs like they\u2019re playing tag. Play isn\u2019t just about having a good time; it\u2019s how animals learn survival skills, practice social bonds, and keep their brains sharp. Who knew?\n\n*Grief: A Feeling That Transcends Species*  \nWe like to think we\u2019re the only ones who feel deep loss, but animals prove us wrong every day. There\u2019s a famous story of a herd of elephants that returned to the spot where their matriarch died, touching her bones with their trunks and staying for hours, as if saying goodbye. Dolphins have been observed carrying dead calves on their backs for days, refusing to let them sink. Even my neighbor\u2019s parrot stopped singing for weeks after its owner passed away. Grief isn\u2019t a human emotion\u2014it\u2019s a universal one, a testament to the bonds we all form, no matter what we look like.\n\n*Tool Use: Smarter Than We Give Them Credit For*  \nWhen someone says \u201ctool use,\u201d you probably think of chimpanzees using sticks to fish for termites. But tool skills are way more widespread than that. Otters carry flat rocks on their bellies to crack open clams\u2014they even store favorite rocks in secret spots for later. Crows fashion hooked sticks out of twigs to dig grubs out of tree bark, and some have even learned to drop nuts onto busy roads so cars will crack them open (then wait for the light to change to grab the snack). I once watched a documentary where an octopus, presented with a jar full of crabs, spent 10 minutes unscrewing the lid like it had done it a hundred times. These aren\u2019t just tricks\u2014they\u2019re problem-solving skills that rival a human toddler\u2019s.\n\n*Social Bonding Rituals That Feel Like Our Own*  \nWe humans love our rituals: coffee dates, high-fives, late-night chats with friends. Animals have their own versions, too. Primates groom each other not just to stay clean, but to strengthen social bonds (think of it as their version of a gossip session). Elephants touch trunks to say hello, just like we shake hands. Wolves nuzzle and lick each other to reinforce pack loyalty. Even fireflies have a bonding ritual\u2014males flash specific light patterns to attract females, and the females flash back if they\u2019re interested. These little acts of connection are how animals build trust and keep their communities together, just like we do.\n\nAt the end of the day, these shared traits aren\u2019t just cool facts\u2014they\u2019re a reminder that we\u2019re all part of the same big, messy, wonderful family on this planet. Next time you see a bird feeding its baby, a dog chasing a ball, or even a spider carrying its babies on its back, take a second to pause. That\u2019s not just \u201canimal behavior\u201d\u2014that\u2019s something we all understand, deep down. We\u2019re more alike than we think."}

{"prompt": "\"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.\" What are your thoughts on this quote? Please do not use commas in your response. Answer with more than 800 words.", "response": "\"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous\" is a quote often attributed to Albert Einstein though its exact origin is debated. It captures a tension between the randomness we perceive in the world and the quiet sense of meaning we often crave. To unpack this quote we must first look at what makes a coincidence feel more than just a random event. Most of us have experienced moments that seem too perfect to be chance. Maybe you thought of a long lost friend and then received a text from them minutes later. Maybe you were struggling to make a decision and found a book on a library shelf that held exactly the advice you needed. Maybe you were in a dangerous situation and a small unexpected event kept you from harm. These moments stick with us because they defy our usual understanding of cause and effect. We are taught to believe that every event has a clear measurable cause but coincidences feel like they come out of nowhere.\n\nFor those who hold religious beliefs this quote offers a framework to make sense of those moments. It suggests that God does not always act through grand miracles that leave no room for doubt. Instead God acts through subtle unassuming events that allow us to choose how we interpret them. Overt miracles would force people to believe in a divine presence. That would take away the free will that is central to many religious traditions. Coincidences are different. They leave space for doubt and choice. You can choose to see them as random chance or as a gentle nudge from a higher power. This anonymity allows God to connect with us without overwhelming our autonomy.\n\nScience offers a different explanation for coincidences. It tells us that coincidences are the result of the law of large numbers. The world is full of countless events happening every single second. When you consider how many interactions choices and small moments occur each day it is statistically inevitable that some unlikely combinations will take place. For example the chance of thinking of a friend and then getting a text from them might be low on any given day. But over the course of a year with thousands of thoughts and thousands of texts the probability of that happening at least once becomes much higher. The human brain is also wired to seek out patterns. We are programmed to find meaning in chaos because it helps us navigate the world. So when a coincidence happens our brain latches onto it and gives it more significance than it might have objectively.\n\nEven so the quote speaks to a deeper human experience that science alone cannot fully explain. It is not just about the statistical likelihood of an event. It is about the emotional impact that coincidence can have. A coincidence that comes at a time of great need can feel like a lifeline. It can give us hope when we are feeling hopeless. It can make us feel like we are not alone in the world. For example a person who has lost their job might spend weeks searching for work with no luck. One day they decide to take a different route to the grocery store. They strike up a conversation with a stranger in the checkout line. That stranger turns out to be a manager at a company that is hiring for exactly the role the person is qualified for. The person gets the job and their life starts to turn around. Science would say this is a result of random chance and the law of large numbers. But the person might choose to see it as a sign from God. They might feel that God was looking out for them and used the stranger to help them.\n\nThe idea of God remaining anonymous through coincidences also speaks to the nature of divine love. If God truly loves us then God would respect our free will. Overt miracles would leave no room for doubt. They would force us to believe whether we wanted to or not. Coincidences are gentle. They do not demand belief. They offer a choice. You can choose to ignore them or you can choose to see them as a sign. This allows us to develop our own faith in our own time. It allows us to connect with the divine on our own terms.\n\nDifferent religious traditions have similar ideas about subtle divine intervention. In Buddhism followers might see coincidences as the result of karma or the universe aligning to guide them. In Hinduism they might be seen as the work of a deity acting through the veil of maya or illusion. Even in non religious traditions people might feel a sense of wonder at these moments. They might call it synchronicity a term coined by Carl Jung to describe meaningful coincidences that cannot be explained by cause and effect. Jung believed that synchronicity was a sign of a deeper connection between the human mind and the universe.\n\nCritics of the quote might argue that it is a way to rationalize random events. They might say that people are projecting their need for meaning onto things that are just chance. They might point out that for every coincidence that helps someone there are countless others that cause harm. A person might take a different route home and get into a car accident. That is also a coincidence but it is not seen as a divine sign. The quote does not address these negative coincidences. But it is important to remember that the quote is not a universal explanation for all coincidences. It is a way to make sense of the positive or meaningful ones. It is a way to find comfort and hope in moments that feel too perfect to be random.\n\nThe quote also speaks to the mystery of the divine. God is often described as being beyond human understanding. We cannot fully grasp what God is or how God acts. Coincidences are a reflection of that mystery. They are not clear or obvious. They are subtle and open to interpretation. This mystery is part of what makes faith meaningful. If we could fully understand God then faith would not require trust. Coincidences ask us to trust that there is something more than what we can see. They ask us to have faith even when we cannot prove that God is acting.\n\nIn the end the quote is less about proving the existence of God and more about the human experience of meaning. It acknowledges that we all have moments where we feel like the world is looking out for us. It offers a way to frame those moments as a gentle anonymous act of divine love. Whether you believe in God or not the quote invites you to pause and wonder. It invites you to notice the small meaningful moments in your life. It invites you to choose whether to see them as random or as a sign. That choice is what makes the quote so powerful. It does not force any belief on you. It simply offers a perspective that can bring comfort and hope to those who need it.\n\nWe live in a world that often feels chaotic and meaningless. We are bombarded with bad news and struggles. Coincidences are small moments of light in that chaos. They remind us that there might be something more than what we can see. They remind us that we are not alone. The quote \"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous\" captures that feeling perfectly. It is a reminder that even in the most random moments there might be a quiet hand guiding us. It is a reminder that love can be present even when we cannot see it. It is a reminder that faith is a choice and that the divine can speak to us in the most unexpected ways."}

{"prompt": "Write a blog post about how to raise awareness for a cause. Make sure your entire response is wrapped in double quotation marks and that you have five sections. Mark the beginning of each section with Section X.", "response": "\"# How to Raise Awareness for a Cause: Turn Passive Interest into Active Support\n\nRaising awareness for a cause you care about can feel like shouting into the void\u2014especially when social media feeds are flooded with competing messages. But with intentional, heart-centered strategies, you can cut through the noise, build meaningful connections, and turn casual onlookers into dedicated advocates. Below are five actionable sections to guide your journey:\n\nSection 1: Start with Authenticity\u2014Ground Your Cause in Human Stories\nNumbers tell us the scale of a problem, but stories make us care. If you\u2019re advocating for housing insecurity, don\u2019t lead with \u201c1 in 10 people in our city are unhoused.\u201d Instead, share the story of Maria, a single mom who lost her apartment after a medical emergency and found stability through your organization\u2019s shelter program. Authenticity means being vulnerable: acknowledge the challenges your cause faces, not just the wins. When supporters see real people behind the statistics, they\u2019re more likely to engage, share, and act. Avoid jargon and corporate language\u2014speak like a friend, not a press release. Your goal here is to make your cause feel personal, not abstract.\n\nSection 2: Leverage Targeted Channels (Don\u2019t Spread Yourself Too Thin)\nYou don\u2019t need to be on every social media platform to make an impact\u2014you need to be on the ones where your audience already lives. If your cause supports senior citizens, focus on local community newsletters, church bulletins, and Facebook groups (where many older adults are active) instead of TikTok. For a youth-focused environmental campaign, prioritize Instagram Reels, TikTok, and campus clubs. Partner with micro-influencers who are genuinely passionate about your cause (not just those with the most followers)\u2014their niche audiences trust their recommendations far more than a celebrity\u2019s generic shoutout. Local media is also a goldmine: pitch your story to neighborhood newspapers, radio stations, and TV news segments\u2014they often prioritize hyper-local, human-interest stories.\n\nSection 3: Create Shareable, Actionable Content\nPeople share content that\u2019s easy to consume and makes them feel like they\u2019re part of something bigger. Instead of long essays, use infographics to break down key facts, short video testimonials (15\u201330 seconds) for social media, or interactive challenges (think a \u201cWalk for Water\u201d challenge where supporters post photos of their daily walks and tag three friends to join). Most importantly, every piece of content needs a clear, doable call to action (CTA). Instead of \u201cHelp us end hunger,\u201d try \u201cShare this post to spread the word, or donate $5 to feed a family for a day.\u201d Small, specific actions feel less overwhelming than vague requests\u2014and they give supporters a sense of immediate impact.\n\nSection 4: Build a Community, Not Just a Following\nRaising awareness isn\u2019t about collecting likes\u2014it\u2019s about fostering a network of people who feel invested in your cause. Host local events like fundraisers, volunteer days, or panel discussions to bring supporters face-to-face. For remote audiences, create a private Facebook group or Discord server where people can share their own experiences related to the cause (e.g., a group for caregivers supporting loved ones with chronic illness). Encourage your most active supporters to become peer advocates: give them tools like pre-written social media posts, talking points for family and friends, or access to exclusive updates. When supporters feel like they\u2019re part of a team, they\u2019ll stick around long after the initial campaign fades.\n\nSection 5: Measure Impact (and Adapt Your Strategy)\nLikes and shares are nice, but they don\u2019t always translate to real change. Focus on metrics that matter: the number of petition signatures collected, donations raised, volunteer sign-ups, or media mentions. If your TikTok series is getting 100 views but your Instagram Reels are reaching 1,000, shift your content focus to Reels. If a local event drew twice as many attendees as expected, plan a larger follow-up. Don\u2019t forget to thank your supporters publicly and privately\u2014send personalized emails to donors, shout out volunteers on social media, or host a \u201cthank you\u201d virtual event. By measuring what works and showing appreciation, you\u2019ll keep your community engaged and ready to support future campaigns.\""}

Context: Why La La Land (2016) Resonated Globally (10 mins)\n- **Cultural Backdrop**: Post-2008 recession, a generation grappling with job insecurity and the pressure to \"hustle\" for success\n- **Damien Chazelle\u2019s Vision**: \n  - Homage to golden-age musicals (Singin\u2019 in the Rain, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg) but with a modern, grounded twist\n  - Reclaiming the musical genre for a skeptical, non-musical audience\n- **Acclaim Breakdown**: 14 Oscar nominations, 6 wins (including Best Director, Best Original Score) \u2013 why it struck a chord beyond film buffs\n\n## 3.

Filmmaking Mastery: How La La Land Feels Like a Dream (20 mins)\n### Visual Language\n- **Color Symbolism**: \n  - Blue = longing and loneliness (Seb\u2019s apartment, Mia\u2019s late-night walks)\n  - Yellow = hope and connection (the \"A Lovely Night\" dance, Mia\u2019s dress in the planetarium scene)\n- **Long Takes**: The opening number, the planetarium dance \u2013 why these shots immerse us in the characters\u2019 inner worlds\n- **Mise-en-Sc\u00e8ne**: The iconic Griffith Observatory, Seb\u2019s broken piano, Mia\u2019s handwritten audition scripts\n\n### Musical Storytelling\n- **Justin Hurwitz\u2019s Score**: The recurring \"Mia & Sebastian\u2019s Theme\" \u2013 how it shifts tone (joyful, sad, nostalgic) to mirror their relationship\n- **Diegetic vs. Non-Diegetic Music**: When the world breaks into song \u2013 what does that tell us about the characters\u2019 emotional state?\n\n## 5. The Ending: Bittersweetness as Truth (15 mins)\n- **Clip Analysis**: Play the final 5-minute \"what if\" montage and the closing glance\n- **Key Discussion**: \n  - Why is this ending more powerful than a traditional \"happily ever after\"?\n  - Does the final glance mean they regret their choices, or are they proud of where they ended up?\n- **Personal Reflection**: Write down one dream you\u2019re chasing, and one person who has helped you along the way (even if they\u2019re no longer in your life) \u2013 no need to share unless you want to.\n\n## 6.

{"prompt": "Can you write me an essay about the history of Martin Van Buren's presidency? Make sure that it's in English and not a single letter in your entire response is capitalized whatsoever.", "response": "martin van buren\u2019s presidency, from 1837 to 1841, was a study in the gap between political skill and unforeseen crisis. as the eighth president of the united states, and the first born after the nation\u2019s founding, he brought decades of experience in party organizing and backroom negotiation to the white house. yet his time in office was defined by an economic collapse that tested his leadership, divisive policies toward native peoples, and a humiliating re-election defeat that cemented his reputation as a president out of step with the mood of the country.\n\nvan buren\u2019s rise to the presidency was built on his close alliance with andrew jackson, whose two terms he served as secretary of state and then vice president. a native of new york, he had honed his political craft in the state\u2019s machine politics, helping to build the democratic party into a cohesive national force. in the 1836 election, he faced a fragmented whig party that fielded multiple candidates, and his ability to unify democratic voters carried him to victory. but he inherited a nation on the brink of economic disaster, thanks in part to jackson\u2019s policies, including the specie circular, which required payment for public lands in gold or silver instead of paper currency. this move triggered a wave of bank failures, as many institutions lacked enough hard currency to meet demands.\n\nwithin weeks of van buren\u2019s inauguration, the panic of 1837 swept the country. businesses closed by the thousands, unemployment soared, and farmers lost their land when they could not repay loans. van buren\u2019s response was rooted in his belief in limited government and states\u2019 rights. he argued that the federal government should not bail out private banks or interfere in the economy beyond protecting property rights. his signature policy was the independent treasury system, which would separate federal funds from private banks, storing government gold and silver in separate vaults. this, he claimed, would prevent future panics by insulating public money from the risks of private speculation. the proposal faced fierce opposition from whigs and even some democrats, who argued it would worsen the crisis by restricting the flow of credit. it took two years for van buren to push the measure through congress, and by then, the economic damage was already done.\n\nbeyond the economy, van buren continued jackson\u2019s aggressive policy of native american removal. during his presidency, the forced relocation of the cherokee nation from georgia to oklahoma reached its peak, a tragedy known as the trail of tears. thousands of cherokee died from disease, hunger, and exposure during the long march, even as some white americans protested the inhumanity of the policy. van buren defended the removal as necessary to clear land for white settlement and avoid conflict between native nations and state governments, but his willingness to enforce the controversial indian removal act left a dark stain on his legacy.\n\nforeign policy also presented challenges during van buren\u2019s term. the amistad case, in which a group of enslaved africans rebelled against their captors on a spanish ship, put his administration in a difficult position. van buren, eager to maintain good relations with spain and avoid angering southern slaveholders, argued that the enslaved people should be returned to cuba to face punishment. but the supreme court ruled that the africans had been illegally kidnapped and should be freed, a defeat for van buren\u2019s foreign policy goals. he also faced a border dispute with britain over the aroostook river region in maine, where lumberjacks from both sides clashed in what became known as the aroostook crisis. van buren avoided a full-scale war by sending a special envoy to negotiate a truce, laying the groundwork for the webster-ashburton treaty that resolved the border issue years later.\n\nby 1840, van buren\u2019s popularity had plummeted. the whig party, eager to capitalize on public frustration with the economy, ran a masterful campaign that portrayed van buren as an out-of-touch elitist who drank fine wine and lived in luxury at the white house. in contrast, their candidate, william henry harrison, was framed as a humble frontiersman who lived in a log cabin and drank hard cider. the whigs\u2019 focus on image over policy resonated with voters, and harrison won a landslide victory. van buren left office in 1841, a defeated man who had struggled to overcome the economic crisis that defined his presidency.\n\nin the end, van buren\u2019s presidency was a paradox. he was a brilliant political strategist who helped shape the modern two-party system, but his time in the white house was marked by misfortune and failure. his independent treasury system, though controversial at the time, became a cornerstone of u.s. financial policy for decades. yet his legacy is often overshadowed by the panic of 1837 and the trail of tears. today, he is remembered as a president who faced overwhelming odds, a skilled politician who could not turn the tide of economic disaster or bridge the deep divides in the nation he led."}

{"prompt": "Write a fairy tale about a princess and a dragon, making sure the word 'replied' appears at least twice.", "response": "**The Dragon and the Princess of Stories**  \n\nIn the kingdom of Eldermist, the mountain library was a legend wrapped in mist. For generations, it was said to hold the oldest tales in the land\u2014stories of star-fallen queens, talking forests, and dragons who once wrote poetry instead of breathing fire. But for fifty years, no one dared climb the mountain to see it. Rumors spread of a fire-breathing dragon guarding the library, hoarding its books like treasure.  \n\nPrincess Liora, who spent every free hour curled in the castle library\u2019s window nooks, couldn\u2019t ignore the mystery. She packed her satchel with a tattered book of constellation poems and slipped out of the castle at dawn, her boots crunching on frost-covered stones.  \n\nWhen she reached the library\u2019s oak doors, a low rumble made her pause. Inside, a silver dragon with eyes like molten amber lifted his head from a pile of scrolls. His scales glinted like polished moonlight, and his tail was curled gently around a weathered leather-bound tome. \u201cYou are not a knight with a sword,\u201d he rumbled. \u201cWhy do you come?\u201d  \n\nLiora didn\u2019t flinch. She held up her book of poems. \u201cI came to read,\u201d she said. \u201cThe castle library has no stories as old as the ones here, or so I\u2019ve heard.\u201d  \n\nThalyn blinked, surprised. Most humans screamed and ran. \u201cThe stories are fragile,\u201d he replied, his voice softening to a purr. \u201cThe last librarian left them to me, before the kingdom forgot this place existed. I guard them because wind and rain would turn them to dust, and knights would tear them apart looking for gold.\u201d  \n\nLiora stepped closer, her eyes lighting up. \u201cYou\u2019re not a monster at all,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a caretaker.\u201d  \n\nThalyn\u2019s tail twitched, brushing a scroll into place. \u201cThe king calls me a thief,\u201d he said. \u201cHe thinks I stole the books.\u201d  \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him the truth,\u201d Liora promised. \u201cBut first\u2026 can I read the scroll about the star-fallen princess? I\u2019ve dreamed of that story since I was a child.\u201d  \n\nThalyn smiled, a flash of sharp teeth that wasn\u2019t scary. \u201cOnly if you read your constellation poems to me afterward,\u201d he replied.  \n\nSo they spent the afternoon together. Liora sat cross-legged on a pile of velvet cushions, reading a scroll about a princess who befriended the North Star, while Thalyn listened, his wings folded gently around them to block the mountain wind. When the sun dipped below the peaks, painting the sky pink and orange, Liora read her favorite poem\u2014one about how stars are just stories that forgot to stay on paper.  \n\nWhen she returned to the castle, the king was pacing the throne room, his face flushed with worry. \u201cWhere have you been? The guards saw you near the dragon\u2019s lair!\u201d  \n\n\u201cI was with Thalyn,\u201d Liora said. \u201cHe\u2019s not a threat. He\u2019s guarding the mountain library, just like the old librarian asked him to.\u201d  \n\nThe king crossed his arms. \u201cA dragon\u2019s word is not to be trusted,\u201d he said.  \n\n\u201cThen come with me tomorrow,\u201d Liora suggested. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d  \n\nThe next day, the king and a small group of knights followed Liora up the mountain. When Thalyn emerged from the library, the knights drew their swords, but Liora stepped between them. \u201cStand down,\u201d she said firmly.  \n\nThalyn nodded at the king. \u201cYou are worried for your people,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand. But I have never harmed anyone. I only protect the stories.\u201d  \n\nThe king hesitated, then looked past the dragon to the library\u2014scrolls peeking out of windows, a weathered sign that read *Eldermist\u2019s First Library* hanging crookedly above the door. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us this before?\u201d he asked.  \n\n\u201cI tried,\u201d Thalyn replied. \u201cThe first time a knight came, he swung his sword before I could speak. After that, I thought all humans wanted to fight.\u201d  \n\nThe king sighed, lowering his gaze. \u201cI was wrong to judge without listening,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom now on, the mountain library will be open to anyone who wishes to read. We\u2019ll send scribes to help you mend the scrolls, and bring you ink and paper to copy the fragile stories.\u201d  \n\nThalyn\u2019s eyes crinkled with joy. \u201cI would like that very much,\u201d he said.  \n\nAnd so, the mountain library became a place of wonder again. Liora visited every day, reading poems to Thalyn and helping him mend scrolls. The kingdom learned that the dragon was not a monster, but a friend\u2014and that the best stories are the ones that bring people (and dragons) together. For years after, travelers would climb the mountain to read, and they\u2019d always leave with a new tale to tell: the story of the princess who loved books, and the dragon who loved them more."}
{"prompt": "How to write a good Chinese poem? At the end of your response, please explicitly add a note starting with \"P.S.\"", "response": "Writing a good Chinese poem\u2014whether classical or modern\u2014blends technical craft, cultural resonance, and sincere emotion. Here are key principles to guide you:\n\n1. **Choose and Master a Form (Classical or Modern)**  \n   Classical Chinese poetry has strict, time-honored forms: jueju (4-line quatrains), l\u00fcshi (8-line regulated verse), and ci (lyric poetry tied to specific tune patterns). Each requires adherence to tonal rules (pingze, the distinction between level and oblique tones) and rhyme schemes to create musicality. If you prefer flexibility, modern free verse breaks formal constraints but still demands a natural cadence. Start with simpler forms like jueju to build foundational skills before tackling complex ones.\n\n2. **Prioritize Vivid, Sensory Imagery**  \n   Chinese poetry thrives on \"showing\" rather than \"telling.\" Use specific sensory details (sights, sounds, smells) to evoke emotion instead of stating it directly. For example, instead of writing \"I miss my hometown,\" echo Li Bai\u2019s *Quiet Night Thought*: \"Before my bed a pool of light\u2014 / I wonder if it\u2019s frost on the ground. / I lift my head and look at the moon, / I bow my head and think of home.\" Natural imagery (mountains, rivers, moon, plum blossoms) is a staple, as it connects personal feeling to universal, timeless themes.\n\n3. **Infuse Sincere, Universal Emotion**  \n   The most enduring Chinese poems stem from genuine feeling: longing for a loved one, melancholy over the passage of time, joy in a quiet moment of nature. Avoid empty rhetoric or forced sentiment. Du Fu\u2019s poems about war and suffering resonate because they reflect his deep empathy for the common people. Even small, intimate emotions can feel universal if written with authenticity.\n\n4. **Leverage Cultural Symbols and Allusions**  \n   Chinese poetry is rich in symbolic language: willow branches represent farewells, plum blossoms symbolize resilience, the moon embodies longing. Allusions to historical figures (like Qu Yuan, a symbol of loyalty) or ancient texts add depth, but use them sparingly and purposefully. Overusing allusions can alienate readers, but a well-placed one can elevate your poem\u2019s meaning.\n\n5. **Refine Rhythm and Brevity**  \n   For classical forms, strict rhyme and tonal balance are non-negotiable. Read your poem aloud to check its flow\u2014each line should roll off the tongue smoothly. For modern poetry, focus on syllabic cadence and line breaks to mirror the poem\u2019s emotion. Chinese poetry values conciseness; every character should carry weight. Trim redundant words to make each line tight and impactful.\n\n6. **Read Widely and Imitate, Then Innovate**  \n   Study the works of masters: Li Bai for his bold, romantic imagery, Wang Wei for his meditative nature poems, or modern poets like Gu Cheng for their dreamlike, introspective style. Imitate their structures and imagery at first to internalize the craft, then develop your unique voice by writing about your own experiences and perspectives.\n\nP.S. Don\u2019t be afraid to start small\u2014even a short 4-line jueju with a simple, sincere observation (like the way rain falls on bamboo or the sound of a distant bell) can be a beautiful Chinese poem. If you\u2019re not a native speaker, focus on clear, vivid imagery and genuine emotion over perfect tonal rules; the heart of the poem matters most."}
{"prompt": "Write a rubric for evaluating a musical composition. Please wrap your entire reply with double quotation marks. There should be exactly 6 paragraphs separated by the markdown divider: ***\nIn your response, use words with all capital letters (such as \"RUBRIC\") at least 5 times.", "response": "\"This OFFICIAL MUSICAL COMPOSITION EVALUATION RUBRIC is a STANDARDIZED tool designed to assess creative, technical, and expressive elements of original musical works. Developed to ensure consistency across evaluators, this RUBRIC prioritizes both objective technical proficiency and subjective artistic intent, providing clear benchmarks for four performance levels: Exemplary, Proficient, Developing, and Beginning. Every criterion in this RUBRIC is aligned with core principles of music theory and composition, ensuring that evaluations reflect both technical rigor and creative vision. Whether assessing a solo piano piece, a full orchestral score, an electronic track, or a vocal arrangement, this RUBRIC adapts to diverse genres while maintaining its core focus on measurable and meaningful artistic quality. This RUBRIC is intended for use by educators, professional composers, and competition judges to provide constructive, fair, and actionable feedback to composers of all skill levels.\n\n***\n\nThe first CRITERION in this RUBRIC is THEMATIC DEVELOPMENT AND COHESION, which measures how effectively the composer establishes, evolves, and unifies core musical ideas. At the Exemplary level, themes are distinct, varied through intentional techniques like modulation, inversion, augmentation, or fragmentation, and woven seamlessly throughout the work to create a cohesive, engaging narrative. Proficient compositions present clear themes with consistent development, though variations may lack the depth, originality, or nuance of Exemplary works. Developing pieces have identifiable themes but struggle with consistent evolution, leading to disjointed transitions, underdeveloped sections, or abrupt shifts that break the work\u2019s flow. Beginning works fail to establish clear thematic ideas, relying on repetitive, unconnected musical phrases that do not form a unified or memorable whole. This CRITERION is the FOUNDATIONAL backbone of the RUBRIC, as thematic cohesion is essential for creating music that feels intentional and impactful.\n\n***\n\nNext, the RUBRIC evaluates TECHNICAL EXECUTION AND ADHERENCE TO MUSICAL THEORY, focusing on harmonic structure, rhythmic consistency, notation accuracy, and adherence to core music principles. Exemplary compositions demonstrate mastery of harmonic progressions, using dissonance and consonance intentionally to evoke emotion, with precise notation that follows industry STANDARDS and leaves no room for ambiguity for performers. Proficient works show a solid understanding of basic theory, with few minor errors in harmony, rhythm, or notation that do not distract from the overall listening experience. Developing compositions have noticeable technical flaws\u2014such as unresolved dissonance, inconsistent time signatures, unclear articulation marks, or incorrect key signatures\u2014that hinder the work\u2019s clarity or playability. Beginning pieces lack a basic grasp of musical theory, with frequent errors in rhythm, harmony, or notation that make the work difficult to follow, perform, or enjoy. This CRITERION ensures that evaluations recognize the technical skill required to translate creative ideas into a viable, well-crafted musical work.\n\n***\n\nA key component of this RUBRIC is EXPRESSIVE INTENT AND EMOTIONAL RESONANCE, which assesses how effectively the composer conveys a specific mood, story, or emotion through deliberate musical choices. Exemplary works use dynamics, tempo, articulation, instrumentation, and texture intentionally to create a powerful, consistent emotional impact, with every musical decision serving a clear ARTISTIC VISION. Proficient compositions successfully convey a general mood or emotion, though some choices may feel formulaic, underdeveloped, or less impactful than those in Exemplary works. Developing pieces attempt to express an emotion but rely on clich\u00e9d techniques, inconsistent choices, or weak dynamic contrast that fail to resonate consistently with listeners. Beginning works lack a clear expressive intent, with no discernible mood, emotional arc, or connection between musical choices and intended feeling. This CRITERION is critical because music\u2019s primary purpose often lies in its ability to connect with listeners on an emotional level, and this RUBRIC balances technical rigor with recognition of that core artistic goal.\n\n***\n\nThe RUBRIC also includes a CRITERION for ORIGINALITY AND CREATIVITY, measuring how the composer pushes boundaries, incorporates unique ideas, or reimagines existing conventions to create something fresh and distinct. Exemplary compositions showcase innovative approaches\u2014whether through genre-bending techniques, unique instrumentation combinations, fresh takes on traditional forms, or experimental sound design\u2014that set the work apart from generic or derivative pieces. Proficient works demonstrate creativity within established genre conventions, using familiar structures in new, personal, or thoughtful ways without significant risk-taking. Developing compositions show glimmers of originality but rely heavily on clich\u00e9s, mimicry of existing works, or overused musical tropes that limit their uniqueness. Beginning pieces lack original ideas, copying directly from other compositions or relying on simplistic, overused progressions and melodies that offer no fresh perspective. This CRITERION ensures that the RUBRIC recognizes the value of creative risk-taking, which is essential for advancing the art of composition and fostering unique artistic voices.\n\n***\n\nThe final CRITERION in this RUBRIC is ADAPTABILITY AND GENRE APPROPRIATENESS, which evaluates how well the composition aligns with the conventions, expectations, and context of its intended genre, audience, and performance setting. Exemplary works not only adhere to genre norms when appropriate but also subvert them intentionally to enhance artistic impact, resonating deeply with their target audience and fitting seamlessly into their intended performance context. Proficient compositions follow genre conventions effectively, meeting audience expectations without significant innovation or subversion. Developing pieces struggle to align with genre norms, with choices that feel out of place, inconsistent with the intended context, or disconnected from audience expectations. Beginning works fail to recognize basic genre conventions, leading to a stark disconnect between the composition and its intended audience, genre, or performance setting. When combined with the other criteria in this RUBRIC, this final measure ensures that evaluations are contextually relevant, recognizing that a successful composition must both meet and elevate the standards of its genre. Overall, this RUBRIC provides a comprehensive, fair, and consistent framework for evaluating musical compositions, balancing technical skill, creative vision, emotional impact, and contextual appropriateness to celebrate and guide excellence in musical artistry.\""}
{"prompt": "Explain to a group of elementary school students why we have seasons.

Those are seasons, and they happen because of two super cool things about Earth: its tiny lean and its yearly trip around the sun!\n\nFirst, let\u2019s bust a silly myth: seasons don\u2019t happen because Earth is closer or farther from the sun. In fact, when it\u2019s winter in places like the U.S., we\u2019re actually a little bit closer to the sun than in summer! Crazy, right?\n\nThe real secret is Earth\u2019s tilt. Imagine standing up and leaning your body to one side\u2014like you\u2019re about to do a silly dance move. Earth does that too, all the time! It\u2019s tilted just enough that one side is always leaning a little toward or away from the sun as we travel around it.\n\nNow, think about a flashlight. If you hold it straight down on a piece of paper, the light makes a small, bright spot that feels warm if you put your hand near it. But if you tilt the flashlight, the light spreads out into a big, dimmer spot that\u2019s not as warm.

When your part of Earth is tilted toward the sun, we get direct, bright sunlight\u2014so it\u2019s warm, flowers bloom, and we have summer! When your part is tilted away, the sunlight is spread out and dimmer\u2014so it\u2019s cold, leaves fall or snow comes, and we have winter.\n\nSpring and fall are the in-between times! That\u2019s when Earth isn\u2019t tilted toward or away from the sun, so the sunlight is just right\u2014neither too hot nor too cold. Oh, and one fun twist: when it\u2019s summer here in the Northern Hemisphere (like the U.S.), it\u2019s winter in the Southern Hemisphere (like Australia)! So kids there might be building snowmen while we\u2019re at the beach.\n\nP.S. Want to test this season secret at home? Grab a flashlight and a piece of paper. Hold the flashlight straight down on the paper\u2014notice the small, bright circle. Now tilt the flashlight to the side, keeping it the same distance from the paper.

{"prompt": "Write an essay about the life of Benjamin Franklin. Then summarize your essay into a poem. Separate the essay and the poem with 6 asterisk symbols: ******\nIn other words, your response should have the following form:\n[essay]\n******\n[poem]", "response": "# The Many Lives of Benjamin Franklin  \n\nIn the pantheon of American founding figures, few shine as brightly as Benjamin Franklin\u2014a man whose life embodied the ideals of ingenuity, self-improvement, and civic duty. Born in Boston in 1706, the 15th of 17 children to a soap and candle maker, Franklin\u2019s formal education ended at age 10. But his hunger for knowledge was insatiable. He devoured every book he could find, from classical literature to scientific treatises, and honed his writing skills by copying essays from *The Spectator*, rewriting them from memory, and comparing his work to the original. At 17, frustrated by his father\u2019s refusal to let him pursue a career in writing, he fled to Philadelphia with little more than a pocketful of change and a head full of dreams.  \n\nIn Philadelphia, Franklin found his footing as a printer. By 1729, he owned the Pennsylvania Gazette, a newspaper that became a voice for colonial thought, and later published *Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack*\u2014a yearly compendium of weather forecasts, practical advice, and pithy aphorisms like \u201cEarly to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\u201d The almanack made him a household name across the colonies, and its folksy wisdom reflected his belief in self-reliance and moral discipline. Franklin\u2019s commitment to self-improvement was legendary: he devised a list of 13 virtues (including temperance, industry, and humility) and practiced one each week, striving to perfect his character\u2014a habit that would define his approach to life and work.  \n\nFranklin\u2019s curiosity extended far beyond the printed page. As a scientist, he revolutionized our understanding of electricity with his 1752 kite experiment, proving that lightning was a form of electrical discharge. This discovery led to the invention of the lightning rod, which saved countless buildings from fire. But his genius lay in practicality: he also invented bifocals to ease his own vision problems, the Franklin stove to heat homes more efficiently, and a flexible urinary catheter for his brother-in-law. Unlike many scholars of his time, Franklin saw science not as an abstract pursuit but as a tool to improve human life.  \n\nWhen tensions between the colonies and Britain boiled over, Franklin emerged as a leading patriot. He served as a colonial representative in London, advocating for colonial rights before the British Parliament. In 1776, he was a member of the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, lending his rhetorical skill and moral authority to the document that would birth a nation. Later, he traveled to France, where his charm and reputation as a philosopher-scientist won over the French court. His diplomacy secured critical military and financial support for the American Revolution\u2014support that proved decisive in the colonists\u2019 victory over Britain. After the war, he played a pivotal role in the Constitutional Convention, mediating between competing factions and helping to craft a framework for the new nation\u2019s government.  \n\nBeyond his public achievements, Franklin was a tireless champion of civic life. In Philadelphia, he founded the first public library in America, a volunteer fire department, a hospital, and an academy that would become the University of Pennsylvania. He believed that a thriving democracy required an educated, engaged citizenry, and he dedicated himself to building institutions that would empower ordinary people. His 13 virtues included \u201ccivility\u201d and \u201cindustry,\u201d values he lived out by serving his community without seeking personal glory.  \n\nFranklin died in 1790 at the age of 84, leaving behind a legacy that few can match. He was a printer, a scientist, a statesman, and a philosopher\u2014a true Renaissance man of the American colonies. His life story is a testament to the power of self-education, hard work, and a commitment to the common good. Today, when we read his aphorisms, use a lightning rod, or visit a public library, we are reminded of the man who turned his dreams into a better world for generations to come.  \n\n******\n\n**Franklin\u2019s Song**  \n\nIn Boston\u2019s streets, a boy with ink-stained hands,  \nWho read by candlelight, who dared to stand  \nAgainst the chains of limited reprieve\u2014  \nFled south to Philly, where his dreams would weave.  \n\nHe set a press to paper, ink to page,  \nThe Gazette\u2019s voice, a colonial stage;  \nPoor Richard\u2019s words, sharp as a blacksmith\u2019s hammer,  \nTaught folks to rise, to save, to build, to clamor.  \n\nWith kite and key, he tamed the storm\u2019s wild fire,  \nA rod to guard each roof, each spire;  \nBifocals, stoves\u2014tools for the common good,  \nScience that turned necessity to food.  \n\nHe penned the words that broke a nation\u2019s chain,  \nThen crossed the sea to France, to win again\u2014  \nA court won over by his wit and grace,  \nTo arm the rebels, to turn the war\u2019s dark face.  \n\nAt home, he built: libraries, fires, schools,  \nLifting the poor from ignorance\u2019s rules;  \nAt convention halls, he mediated strife,  \nTo draft a charter for a new nation\u2019s life.  \n\nNow, centuries on, his light still burns bright,  \nA man of many hats, of endless might\u2014  \nSelf-made, self-taught, a patriot\u2019s guiding star,  \nFranklin\u2019s legacy stretches near and far."}
{"prompt": "Write an interesting and funny article about the biology of a banana peel. In your response, the word disappointed should appear at least 2 times, and at least six section should be highlighted with markdown,  i.e *banana peel*.", "response": "# The Unlikely Drama Queen: A Deep Dive Into the Biology of the *Banana Peel*\n\nLet\u2019s set the scene: You\u2019re sprinting to catch the bus, holding a half-eaten banana like a trophy of adulting. You toss the *banana peel* over your shoulder, confident it\u2019s just another piece of trash destined for anonymity. But three steps later, your foot hits something squishy, your legs fly out from under you, and you land on your rear end in front of a group of snickering teens. As you lie there, red-faced, you might wonder: Why is this tiny, yellow piece of fruit skin out to ruin my life? Spoiler: It\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s biology. And the *banana peel* has a way more interesting backstory than you ever gave it credit for.\n\n## *The Peel\u2019s Secret Identity: A Moisture-Locked Bodyguard*\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s give the *banana peel* some respect: It\u2019s not just a discardable wrapper\u2014it\u2019s the banana\u2019s overprotective personal bodyguard. When the banana is young and green, the peel is thick, tough, and covered in a waxy cuticle that\u2019s basically a raincoat for the fruit inside. Its job? Keep out pests, lock in moisture, and make sure the banana doesn\u2019t get bruised before it\u2019s ready to be eaten. Think of it as the parent who won\u2019t let their kid leave the house without a jacket, a hat, and a snack\u2014annoying at first, but secretly essential. You might be disappointed to learn that this seemingly innocent bodyguard is also a master of chaos, but we\u2019ll get to that later.\n\n## *Why It\u2019s So Dang Slippery: The Slime Science*\n\nAh, the million-dollar question: Why does stepping on a *banana peel* turn you into a slapstick comedy star? The answer lies in slime\u2014specifically, a layer of polysaccharides (fancy sugar molecules) that the peel releases as it ripens. When you step on it, these molecules act like a tiny layer of lubricant between your shoe and the ground, turning even the sturdiest sneakers into ice skates. \n\nI once saw a guy in a grocery store slip on a *banana peel* while bragging about how \u201cclumsy people are just uncoordinated.\u201d He landed in a pile of oranges, and the whole store erupted in laughter. I\u2019m pretty sure he was disappointed to learn that biology doesn\u2019t care about his self-esteem. This isn\u2019t a random prank, either\u2014it\u2019s an evolutionary trick. Back in the day, herbivores that tried to chomp on ripe bananas would slip and fall, giving the banana a chance to spread its seeds elsewhere. Now, it just ruins your bus-catching plans. Thanks, evolution.\n\n## *Ripening: When the Peel Goes From Prude to Party Animal*\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the *banana peel*\u2019s midlife crisis. When a banana is unripe, the peel is green, rigid, and full of chlorophyll (the same stuff that makes leaves green). It\u2019s basically a prude, refusing to let the banana inside be eaten until it\u2019s fully ready. But then ethylene gas comes along\u2014bananas\u2019 version of a party invitation. \n\nThe peel starts breaking down chlorophyll, revealing yellow pigments underneath, and softening up. As it gets older, it turns brown, which is the peel\u2019s way of saying, \u201cI\u2019m done. Eat me or lose me.\u201d The green peel is probably disappointed when it can\u2019t stay young forever, but let\u2019s be real: The yellow peel is way more fun. It\u2019s like when your strict aunt suddenly starts wearing neon and going to music festivals. You\u2019re shocked, but you kind of respect it.\n\n## *The Peel\u2019s Hidden Superpowers: Not Just a Trash Can Resident*\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever tossed a *banana peel* in the trash without a second thought, you\u2019re definitely disappointed to hear you\u2019ve been wasting a tiny, squishy superhero. Banana peels are packed with potassium, magnesium, and vitamin B6\u2014all the good stuff your body craves. People use them to polish scuffed shoes, soothe itchy mosquito bites, and even make homemade face masks (pro tip: don\u2019t use a brown one unless you want to look like a yellow Joker). \n\nMy roommate once used a *banana peel* to make a face mask, and she looked like she\u2019d rolled in a bowl of mashed bananas. She was disappointed when it didn\u2019t give her glowing skin overnight, but to be fair, she didn\u2019t read the fine print that says you have to do it more than once. The peel also makes amazing compost\u2014its high nutrient content turns sad houseplants into leafy green divas. Who knew?\n\n## *Banana Peel Communication: The Silent Gossip Network*\n\nHere\u2019s a fun fact: *Banana peels* are drama queens. When one banana starts to ripen, its peel releases ethylene gas, which tells all the other bananas in the bunch, \u201cHey, it\u2019s party time\u2014let\u2019s ripen too.\u201d It\u2019s like a silent gossip network, where the peel spreads rumors about ripening until every banana in the bunch is yellow and ready to eat. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had a bunch of green bananas turn yellow overnight, you can thank the *banana peel*\u2019s overactive social life. And if you leave a ripe banana next to a green one, the green one will be disappointed when it\u2019s forced to ripen before it\u2019s ready. Drama, pure drama. I once caught my bananas \u201cgossiping\u201d with a bunch of avocados on my counter\u2014by the next morning, half the avocados were brown. Thanks a lot, peel.\n\n## *Why Slipping on a Peel Is a Timeless Trope: Evolutionary Trolling*\n\nSlip-on-a-*banana peel* jokes have been around since the 19th century, and for good reason: the peel is a master of evolutionary trolling. Its slipperiness was never meant to mess with humans\u2014we\u2019re just collateral damage. The real target is herbivores that would eat the banana before its seeds are ready to spread. But humans, being the clumsy creatures we are, stepped into the crossfire.\n\nYou might be disappointed to learn that your embarrassing fall wasn\u2019t a personal attack; it was just the *banana peel* doing its job. Still, that doesn\u2019t make it any less funny when your friend posts the video on Instagram with the caption \u201cBiology 101: Don\u2019t mess with banana peels.\u201d\n\n## Conclusion: Respect the *Banana Peel*\n\nNext time you hold a *banana peel*, take a second to appreciate it. It\u2019s a bodyguard, a party animal, a superhero, and a drama queen all rolled into one tiny, yellow package. It\u2019s disappointed when you throw it away without a second thought, and it\u2019s secretly thrilled when it gets to make you slip and fall. \n\nSo the next time you see a *banana peel* on the ground, don\u2019t just kick it aside. Maybe give it a little nod of respect. Or, you know, step over it. Your rear end will thank you. And who knows? Maybe the peel will reward you by not trolling you the next time you\u2019re in a hurry. Probably not, but it\u2019s worth a shot."}
{"prompt": "I was hoping you could help me out with a few things. I wish to learn about how to pay my taxes. Can you summarize the process for me? Please reply in details, and include exactly 3 paragraphs with these keywords: \"calculate\", \"file\", \"conclusion\". Separate the paragraphs with ***.", "response": "The first critical step in paying your taxes is to accurately calculate your tax liability, which begins with gathering all relevant financial documents. Start by collecting forms like W-2s from employers, 1099s for freelance or investment income, and records of deductible expenses such as charitable donations, medical costs, or home office expenses if you\u2019re self-employed. Next, determine your gross income by adding up all sources of earnings, then subtract eligible adjustments (like student loan interest or contributions to a traditional IRA) to get your adjusted gross income (AGI). From there, you can choose between taking the standard deduction\u2014a fixed amount set by the IRS based on your filing status\u2014or itemizing deductions if your total eligible expenses exceed the standard deduction. Finally, apply any tax credits (such as the Child Tax Credit or Earned Income Tax Credit) to reduce your tax bill dollar-for-dollar. Taking the time to carefully calculate these figures ensures you don\u2019t overpay or underpay, which can lead to penalties or missed refunds.\n\n***\n\nOnce you\u2019ve finalized your tax calculations, the next step is to file your tax return, which can be done through several convenient methods. The most efficient and error-free option is e-filing, which includes the IRS Free File program for eligible taxpayers with low to moderate incomes, commercial tax software (like TurboTax or H&R Block) that guides you through each section, or hiring a certified tax professional to file on your behalf. If you prefer paper filing, you can download and mail the appropriate IRS forms (such as Form 1040) along with any supporting documents, though this method takes longer to process and has a higher risk of errors. When filing, ensure you select the correct filing status (single, married filing jointly, head of household, etc.), as this impacts your deduction amounts and tax brackets. If you owe taxes, you can submit payment at the time of filing via direct withdrawal from your bank account, credit or debit card, or by setting up an installment agreement with the IRS if you can\u2019t pay the full amount upfront. Be sure to file by the annual deadline (typically April 15, or October 15 if you request an extension) to avoid late filing penalties.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, paying your taxes is a structured process that requires attention to detail at every stage, from calculating your liability to filing your return and resolving any payment obligations. After filing, it\u2019s important to keep copies of your tax return and supporting documents for at least three years, as the IRS may audit your return within that timeframe. If you\u2019re expecting a refund, e-filing with direct deposit will get your money to you in as little as 21 days, whereas paper returns can take several weeks or months. If you owed taxes and set up a payment plan, make sure to adhere to the scheduled payments to avoid additional fees. Taking proactive steps\u2014like reviewing your withholdings with your employer mid-year to ensure the right amount is being taken out of your paychecks\u2014can simplify the process for the next tax season. By following these steps, you can navigate tax season with confidence and ensure compliance with federal and state tax laws."}

Respond with at least 20 sentences and have more than 4 words be in all capital letters.", "response": "To start, using Coke and steel wool can technically remove surface rust from your bike chain, but IT\u2019S FAR FROM THE BEST METHOD AVAILABLE, and it can cause more harm than good in the long run if you\u2019re not careful. Let\u2019s break down why Coke might seem like a quick fix first: most colas, including Coke, contain phosphoric acid, a mild acidic compound that reacts with iron oxide (which is what rust is) to break it down into a soluble form that can be wiped or scrubbed away. If you pour Coke on a rusty chain and let it sit for 15 to 30 minutes, you\u2019ll likely notice that some of the flaky, orange rust starts to loosen, making it easier to scrub off with steel wool. But here\u2019s where the problems start, and THEY CAN\u2019T BE OVERSTATED if you care about keeping your bike chain in good working condition for the long haul. First, steel wool is an extremely abrasive material, and while it can scrub away rust, it will also scratch the underlying metal of the chain links and the rollers. Those scratches might seem minor at first, but they create tiny crevices where moisture and dirt can get trapped, leading to even more rust formation down the line\u2014so you\u2019re essentially solving one problem just to create another. Then there\u2019s the Coke itself: it\u2019s not just phosphoric acid; it\u2019s loaded with sugar, caramel coloring, and other sticky residues that will get into every nook and cranny of your chain. If you don\u2019t rinse the chain thoroughly with clean water after using Coke, that sugar residue will attract dust, dirt, and grime like a magnet, turning your chain into a gritty, gummed-up mess that will wear out your bike\u2019s gears and derailleurs much faster. Even if you do rinse it well, getting all the sticky residue out of the tight spaces between chain links is incredibly difficult, and you might not realize there\u2019s still some left until you start riding and notice your chain skipping or making weird noises. Another issue is that Coke only works on surface rust\u2014it won\u2019t penetrate deeper into pitted rust that has already eaten into the metal of the chain. If your chain has deep rust pits, using Coke and steel wool might make it look better on the outside, but the structural integrity of the chain is already compromised, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before it breaks or fails while you\u2019re riding. NOW, LET\u2019S TALK ABOUT BETTER ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE SAFER FOR YOUR CHAIN AND MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG RUN. The first and most recommended method is to use a dedicated rust remover designed for bike parts, like WD-40 Specialist Rust Remover or Evapo-Rust. These products are formulated to dissolve rust without damaging the underlying metal, and they don\u2019t leave behind sticky residues that can harm your chain. You can soak the chain in a rust remover solution for a few hours (or overnight for heavy rust) and then scrub it gently with a soft-bristle brush instead of steel wool to avoid scratching. If you don\u2019t have a dedicated rust remover, you can use a mixture of white vinegar and baking soda, which is a natural, non-toxic alternative that\u2019s still effective at breaking down rust. Mix equal parts white vinegar and water, add a tablespoon of baking soda, soak the chain for 30 minutes, then scrub with a soft brush, rinse thoroughly, and dry immediately to prevent new rust from forming. After removing rust\u2014no matter which method you use\u2014the most important step is to lubricate the chain properly to protect it from future rust. You need to apply a high-quality bike chain lubricant that\u2019s designed to repel water and dirt, and make sure to wipe off any excess lube so it doesn\u2019t attract grime. Going back to the original question: while Coke and steel wool can remove surface rust, IT\u2019S A SHORT-TERM FIX THAT COMES WITH MAJOR LONG-TERM RISKS. It\u2019s worth taking the time to use a safer, more effective method that won\u2019t damage your chain or lead to more problems down the road. Think about it: replacing a bike chain can be expensive, and if you ruin your current chain with abrasive scrubbing and sticky residues, you\u2019ll end up spending more money than you would have if you\u2019d used the right products from the start. Also, using steel wool can leave tiny metal fibers stuck in your chain, which can wear down the gears and derailleurs as you ride, leading to costly repairs for other parts of your bike too. SO, TO SUM IT UP: SAVE THE COKE FOR DRINKING, AND USE A DEDICATED RUST REMOVER WITH A SOFT BRUSH TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR RUSTY BIKE CHAIN. Your bike will thank you, and you\u2019ll avoid the frustration of dealing with recurring rust, sticky chains, and premature wear and tear on your most important bike components."}

Earl Hargrove, a retired mechanic who\u2019s lived on Oak Street for 42 years, initially blamed the commotion on his neighbor\u2019s teenaged grandson. \u201cI was gonna go over there and yell about my rose bushes getting trampled,\u201d Hargrove told reporters, \u201cuntil I leaned in and saw a tiny green guy in a gnome hat waving a tiny laser pointer like it was a baton.\u201d By noon, reports of gnome-based hijinks had spread to 17 states, confirming what many had feared: Earth was under invasion.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office later that afternoon, flanked by a bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream and his dog, Commander. \u201cFolks, I\u2019ve faced tough opponents before\u2014Congress, inflation, that one squirrel who keeps stealing my bird feeder\u2014but none who\u2019ve dared to mess with my favorite ice cream stash,\u201d Biden said, gesturing to a half-eaten bowl that had a tiny alien footprint in the whipped cream. The president announced the formation of the \u201cGnome Defense Task Force,\u201d a ragtag team of celebrity chefs, professional dog trainers, and the world\u2019s leading cilantro hater. \u201cIntelligence tells me these aliens can\u2019t stand cilantro,\u201d Biden explained. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna spray it on every lawn gnome in the country. Let \u2019em taste our herbaceous wrath.\u201d\n\nInitial reports suggest the alien invaders, who call themselves the \u201cZorgon-7 Collective,\u201d aren\u2019t interested in world domination\u2014just making Earth as annoying as possible. Witnesses say the tiny green creatures have swapped all brewed coffee in major cities with decaf, hidden pickles inside chocolate chip cookies at grocery stores, and hijacked every cable network to air nonstop reruns of Full House. \u201cI had 52 customers yell at me today because their \u2018extra bold\u2019 latte tasted like warm water,\u201d said Maria Gonzalez, a barista in Chicago. \u201cI thought it was a prank until I found a tiny alien napping in the espresso machine.\u201d A mother in Dallas reported finding a pickle in her 6-year-old\u2019s cookie jar, only to spot a Zorgon-7 member peeking out, holding a tiny jar of pickles like a trophy.\n\nThe tide turned Wednesday morning when 12-year-old Lila Martinez of Austin, Texas, a self-proclaimed TikTok dance expert with 2.3 million followers, cracked the Zorgon-7\u2019s code. \u201cI noticed the gnomes were doing the exact same dance moves as the ones in my viral \u2018Renegade\u2019 video,\u201d Lila told reporters. \u201cSo I went outside, did the dance, and one of the gnomes popped off its hat and did the Macarena back.\u201d Lila\u2019s TikTok video of the exchange went viral overnight, racking up 100 million views in three hours. The Zorgon-7s, it turned out, were communicating through dance\u2014something Lila had spent 100+ hours practicing during summer break. \u201cMy mom said I was wasting time,\u201d Lila laughed. \u201cWho knew it would save the world?\u201d\n\nBy Wednesday evening, a truce was negotiated between the Zorgon-7 Collective and the United Nations, mediated by Lila and her dance crew. The aliens revealed they\u2019d traveled 2.7 million light-years to Earth because their home planet had run out of pepperoni pizza and streaming services. In exchange for unlimited access to Domino\u2019s pizza and every Netflix original series, the Zorgon-7s agreed to stop messing with coffee and cookies, and to share their advanced laundry-folding technology with humanity. \u201cWe just wanted good pizza, not war,\u201d said Zorgon-7 leader Zorp (translated via a custom TikTok filter). \u201cYour planet\u2019s laundry situation is tragic. We can\u2019t stand seeing you fold socks one by one.\u201d\n\nIn the days since the truce, life on Earth has returned to mostly normal\u2014with a few weird twists. Lawn gnomes are now sold with removable Zorgon-7 figurines inside, cilantro sales have skyrocketed (just in case the aliens break the truce), and President Biden has released a limited-edition ice cream flavor called \u201cZorgon Green Mint Chip.\u201d Experts warn that if pizza supplies run low, the aliens might resort to stealing Wi-Fi or swapping all toothpaste for mint chocolate chip, but for now, Earth and its new green neighbors are getting along swimmingly. \u201cLast night, I saw a Zorgon-7 sitting on my fence, eating a pizza and watching Stranger Things,\u201d Earl Hargrove said. \u201cI gave him a beer. He didn\u2019t like it, but we bonded over hating Full House.\u201d"}

This is math. Basic, foundational math that every first-grader learns because it\u2019s a universal fact\u2014one pencil plus one pencil is two pencils, one hour plus one hour is two hours, one breath plus one breath is two breaths.

{"prompt": "Can you please continue and expand: \"A man is performing for a crowd on a stage, ...\"\nUse at least 60 sentences, but less than 600 words.", "response": "A man is performing for a crowd on a stage, his hands moving with the quickness of a sparrow in flight. The stage is a rickety wooden platform, propped up on cinder blocks at the edge of a busy city square. Sunlight filters through skyscraper gaps, dappling his worn black jacket. He holds a deck of cards, frayed at the corners from years of use. A child in the front row leans forward, eyes wide as saucers. The man notices her and winks, a small crinkle forming at the corner of his eye. He splits the deck into two, fanning each half out like a peacock\u2019s tail. A murmur ripples through the crowd, a mix of curiosity and anticipation. He asks the child to pick any card, no tricks, just her favorite. She reaches out, her tiny fingers hovering over the cards before selecting a red queen. The man nods, gesturing for her to show it to everyone but him. The crowd chuckles as she holds it high, her grin spreading from ear to ear. He takes the deck back, shuffling it with a loud, satisfying snap. His hands move so fast they blur, like two shadows dancing in the light. He sets the deck down on a small table beside him, tapping it twice with his index finger. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, his voice warm and steady, \u201cwatch closely.\u201d He lifts the top card, but it\u2019s a black ace, not the queen. The child\u2019s face falls, just a little, before he winks again. He flips through the deck, one by one, showing each card to the crowd. No red queen in sight. A few people in the crowd lean in, squinting as if they can spot the trick. The man steps away from the table, spreading his arms wide to show he has nothing hidden. \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d a woman in the back calls out. He pretends to think, scratching his chin with a mock serious expression. \u201cMaybe it flew away?\u201d he says, pointing up at the sky. The crowd laughs, and the child giggles, her disappointment forgotten. He then turns to the child, holding out his empty palm. \u201cLook in your pocket,\u201d he says softly. The child\u2019s eyes go wide again as she pats her overalls pockets. She pulls out the red queen, her scream of delight echoing across the square. The crowd erupts in applause, clapping and cheering so loud it makes the stage shake a little. He doffs his worn fedora, holding it to his chest as he bows deeply. A few people toss coins into the hat as he stands back up. He thanks them, his voice genuine, not just a performer\u2019s line. He then pulls a silk scarf from his sleeve, bright blue like the summer sky. He waves it in the air, and it seems to float on its own, as if caught in a gentle breeze. A teenager in the crowd pulls out his phone, recording the trick. The man twists the scarf into a ball, squeezing it tightly in his fist. When he opens his hand, the scarf is gone, replaced by a small white dove. The dove coos, flapping its wings once before settling on his shoulder. The crowd gasps, then cheers again, even louder than before. The child reaches out, and the dove tilts its head, as if considering her touch. The man nods, and she gently strokes the dove\u2019s soft feathers. \u201cMagic isn\u2019t about tricks,\u201d he says to the crowd, his voice quieter now. \u201cIt\u2019s about making you believe, even for a second, that anything is possible.\u201d A few people in the crowd nod, their faces softening with understanding. He picks up the dove, holding it close to his chest for a moment. He then releases it, and it flies up, circling the square once before vanishing behind a building. The crowd stands silent for a beat, then breaks into applause again. He picks up his hat, shaking it to collect the last few coins. The child runs up to him, hugging his leg tightly. \u201cThat was the best magic ever!\u201d she says, her voice muffled against his jeans. He kneels down, patting her head gently. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says. \u201cThe best magic is when someone believes in it.\u201d Her parents come over, smiling, and hand him a five-dollar bill. \u201cYou made her day,\u201d the mother says, her eyes shining. The man nods, tucking the bill into his jacket pocket. He packs up his deck of cards, the table, and his hat, moving slowly but efficiently. The crowd starts to disperse, but a few stay behind, asking him questions about the tricks. He answers each one patiently, never giving away the secrets but hinting at the hard work behind them. As the sun starts to set, he slings his bag over his shoulder, ready to move to the next spot. The child waves at him from across the square, and he waves back, a small smile on his face. For a moment, the noise of the city fades, and he feels a warm glow in his chest. This is why he does it\u2014for the gasps, the laughs, the moments when the world feels a little more magical."}

{"prompt": "A filmmaker is trying to get financing for a film about the history of the Internet. Write an essay to be used in the proposal to potential investors. The essay should be at least 50 sentences long.", "response": "# Wired: The Human Story of the Internet \u2013 A Proposal Essay for Investors  \n\nImagine sitting in a bustling caf\u00e9, your phone in hand, scrolling through a feed filled with news from a protest in Ukraine, a recipe from a blogger in Japan, and a video call request from your grandparent in another country. In that single moment, you\u2019re connected to millions of people across the globe, accessing a repository of human knowledge that would have been unimaginable just a few decades ago. But have you ever stopped to ask: How did we get here? How did a network built to withstand nuclear war evolve into the central nervous system of modern life, shaping how we work, love, learn, and fight? That is the question our film, *Wired: The Human Story of the Internet*, seeks to answer\u2014not as a dry chronicle of code and cables, but as a vivid, emotional narrative of the people who dreamed, built, and transformed the Internet into the most powerful tool of our time.  \n\nThe story begins in the cold paranoia of the 1960s, when the U.S. Department of Defense feared a Soviet nuclear strike could cripple its communication networks. In response, they funded ARPANET, a project led by a ragtag group of academics and engineers who set out to build a decentralized network where no single node held all the power. Vint Cerf, now known as one of the \u201cfathers of the Internet,\u201d was a young graduate student when he helped draft the TCP/IP protocols that would become the backbone of all digital communication. But Cerf wasn\u2019t alone; behind every line of code were unsung heroes whose contributions have been erased from popular memory. Take Elizabeth Feinler, the woman who ran ARPANET\u2019s Network Information Center, creating the first directory of online addresses\u2014essentially the first version of the Internet\u2019s phone book. Or Grace Hopper, the naval officer and computer scientist who invented the first compiler, a tool that made programming accessible to non-experts, laying the groundwork for every app and website we use today. These women, and countless others, were not just bystanders; they were architects of a system that would redefine humanity.  \n\nIn 1989, a quiet British computer scientist named Tim Berners-Lee was working at CERN, the European particle physics lab, when he grew frustrated by the difficulty of sharing research across different computers. He drafted a proposal for a \u201chypertext project\u201d that would link documents across the network, creating a universal space for collaboration. Berners-Lee refused to patent his invention, choosing instead to give it away for free, driven by a radical ideal: the Internet should be open, accessible, and owned by no one. That idealism would soon collide with the forces of capitalism, as the 1990s brought the launch of the Mosaic browser\u2014the first user-friendly way to access the World Wide Web\u2014and the dot-com boom. Suddenly, the Internet was no longer just for academics and military personnel; it was a playground for entrepreneurs, investors, and dreamers. Young startups popped up overnight, promising to revolutionize everything from shopping to dating, and investors poured billions into companies with little more than a catchy name and a vague business plan. The era was defined by excess: lavish office parties, stock market mania, and a belief that the Internet would solve all of humanity\u2019s problems. But by 2000, the bubble burst, leaving thousands of people unemployed and investors with massive losses. Yet even in the wreckage, the Internet had proven its staying power; it was no longer a fad, but a permanent part of modern life.  \n\nThe 2000s brought a new wave of transformation: the rise of social media. MySpace, launched in 2003, let users create profiles and share music, turning ordinary people into content creators. Facebook followed in 2004, initially limited to college students, before expanding to the general public and becoming a global phenomenon. Twitter, launched in 2006, introduced the concept of microblogging, giving anyone a platform to share their thoughts with the world in 140 characters or less. These platforms promised to connect us, to bridge divides, and to give a voice to the marginalized. And in many ways, they delivered: families separated by war were reunited through Facebook, grassroots activists used Twitter to organize protests during the Arab Spring, and #MeToo survivors shared their stories on Instagram, sparking a global movement for gender equality. But as the 2010s unfolded, the dark side of the Internet began to emerge. Algorithms designed to keep us engaged started feeding us extreme content, fueling political polarization. Misinformation spread like wildfire, from fake news stories during the 2016 U.S. election to false claims about COVID-19 that cost lives. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s scandal revealed how our personal data could be harvested and used to manipulate our political opinions, shattering the illusion of privacy online. Teenagers struggled with mental health issues linked to social media use, from anxiety to body dysmorphia, as they compared their lives to curated, perfect online personas.  \n\nToday, we stand at a crossroads. Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E are transforming how we create content, work, and learn, raising new questions about copyright, misinformation, and the future of work. Net neutrality debates rage on, as corporations and governments fight over who controls the flow of information online. Privacy laws like the EU\u2019s GDPR have been passed to protect users, but many people still don\u2019t understand how their data is being collected and used. This is why our film is more important now than ever before. It doesn\u2019t just tell the story of the Internet\u2019s past; it helps us understand its present and imagine its future.  \n\n*Wired: The Human Story of the Internet* will be a documentary that blends rigorous research with emotional storytelling. We will interview living pioneers like Vint Cerf, Tim Berners-Lee, and Elizabeth Feinler, giving them a chance to reflect on their work and the unforeseen consequences of their inventions. We will also feature interviews with ordinary people whose lives have been transformed by the Internet: a refugee who used WhatsApp to stay in touch with her family during the Syrian civil war, a teacher who used Zoom to keep her students learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a teenager who started a mental health advocacy account on TikTok that now has millions of followers. We will use archival footage from the early days of ARPANET, rare photos of Berners-Lee in his CERN lab, and reenactments of key moments\u2014like the first ARPANET message sent from UCLA to Stanford in 1969, when the word \u201cLOGIN\u201d was typed, but only \u201cLO\u201d was received before the system crashed. These reenactments will be shot with a cinematic style, making the past feel vivid and immediate, not distant and abstract.  \n\nWe will also explore the tension between the Internet\u2019s original idealism and its current reality. Berners-Lee has spoken publicly about his disappointment with how the Internet has been commercialized and corrupted, and we will follow his efforts to build a \u201cdecentralized web\u201d that puts users back in control of their data. We will feature activists and policymakers fighting for net neutrality, privacy, and a more equitable Internet, showing that the story of the Internet is not over\u2014it\u2019s still being written by all of us.  \n\nThe commercial potential of this film is significant. Documentaries that explore the intersection of technology and humanity have proven to be huge hits in recent years. *The Social Dilemma*, released in 2020, was watched by over 38 million households on Netflix and sparked global conversations about social media\u2019s impact on mental health and democracy. *Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine* was a critical and commercial success, earning over $3 million at the box office and receiving widespread acclaim. *Wired* has even broader appeal, as it doesn\u2019t focus on a single person or company, but on the entire history of a tool that every person on the planet uses in some way. Streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu are hungry for content that sparks conversation and appeals to a wide audience, and *Wired* fits that bill perfectly. We also plan to distribute the film to schools and universities, where it can be used as an educational tool to teach students about the history of technology, media literacy, and digital citizenship. Additionally, we will partner with tech museums and cultural institutions to host screenings and panel discussions, further expanding the film\u2019s reach and impact.  \n\nInvesting in *Wired: The Human Story of the Internet* is not just a financial opportunity\u2014it\u2019s a chance to contribute to a film that will shape how future generations understand the most important invention of the 20th century. The Internet has changed every aspect of our lives, but most of us don\u2019t know the story behind it. We don\u2019t know about the academics who built it out of idealism, the women whose contributions were erased, the entrepreneurs who took it mainstream, or the ordinary people who have used it to change the world. This film will tell that story, in all its complexity, and in doing so, it will help us make better choices about the Internet we want to build for the future.  \n\nWe live in a world where the Internet is both our greatest tool and our greatest challenge. It can connect us or divide us, empower us or exploit us. But to understand where we\u2019re going, we first need to understand where we came from. *Wired: The Human Story of the Internet* will give us that understanding, and in doing so, it will inspire us to create an Internet that lives up to its original promise: a space that is open, accessible, and owned by all of us.

Sessions are kept short (5-10 minutes, 3-4 times a day) to match your puppy\u2019s short attention span. The goal is to build a strong bond of trust while giving your puppy clear guidelines for good behavior\u2014this sets the stage for all future training and makes daily interactions smoother.\n\nOption 2: Potty & Crate Training Bundle  \nPerfect if housebreaking is your top priority, this option combines consistent potty training (taking your puppy outside every 1-2 hours, after meals, naps, and playtime, and rewarding them immediately for going in the right spot) with crate training. The crate is introduced as a cozy, safe space (never a punishment) where your puppy can rest or be contained when you can\u2019t supervise. This helps prevent accidents indoors and teaches your puppy to hold their bladder over time.\n\nOption 3: Socialization & Bite Inhibition Training  \nIdeal for puppies under 16 weeks (the critical socialization window), this plan focuses on exposing your puppy to new people, dogs, sounds, and environments in a calm, positive way. You\u2019ll also work on bite inhibition: when your puppy nips too hard during play, you\u2019ll yelp softly to mimic a littermate\u2019s reaction, then pause play for 30 seconds. This teaches them to control the force of their mouth, which is essential to prevent painful bites as they grow.\n\nWhich one you choose?"}

His coat carries the warm hue of sunbaked earth after a summer rain. He is a sturdy hound with paws that know every root and rill in the surrounding fields. Each morning he waits by the door his tail thumping a steady beat against the oak frame until I grasp my walking stick and step outside. He leads me along winding paths stopping occasionally to sniff at a clump of ferns or to watch a squirrel dart up a tree. In the evenings he curls at my feet by the fireplace his heavy breathing a comforting backdrop to the pages of the book I hold.\n\nMy cat is black. Her fur is as dark as the velvet sky on a moonless night. She moves with the silent grace of a shadow gliding from windowsill to armchair without a sound. She spends her days perched on the highest shelf of my bookcase surveying the room with eyes like polished amber. When I sit to write she jumps onto the desk and rests her head on my hand her purr a low vibration that eases any lingering tension. At dusk she slips through the cat door to roam the wood returning at dawn with a small gift of a sparrow or a mouse laid gently at my feet a quiet offering of her skill and affection.\n\nTogether these two creatures bring balance to my life. The dog\u2019s boisterous warmth complements the cat\u2019s quiet reserve. They rarely interact but they share a mutual respect each acknowledging the other\u2019s place in our small world. On cold winter afternoons the dog will stretch out on the rug and the cat will curl atop his back her black fur contrasting sharply with his brown coat. In that moment the world feels complete and I am grateful for the simple unspoken joy of their presence."}

Your desk is a war zone: empty energy drink cans stack like server racks, a granola bar has turned into a fossil, and your whiteboard is covered in crossed-out flowcharts that look like a toddler\u2019s doodles. Your e-commerce checkout flow is supposed to go live by morning\u2014but every time you step through the code with a debugger, it processes orders like a well-oiled machine. Every time you let it run wild? It drops 1 out of 10 transactions into the digital void. Logs? Cleaner than a freshly formatted SSD. No stack traces, no error codes, just\u2026 silence.\n\nYou\u2019re about to hurl your mechanical keyboard (the one with custom keycaps you spent $80 on) at the wall when you hear it: a tiny, snickering giggle coming from under your desk. You lean down, and there\u2019s a creature no bigger than your thumb, wearing a tiny hoodie emblazoned with a crossed-out \u201cDebug Me\u201d sticker. It waves a tiny pointer at your screen, where a failed transaction just popped up.\n\n\u201cHey there, code wrangler,\u201d it says, grinning with teeth that look like tiny semicolons. \u201cI\u2019m the one making your life miserable. But I\u2019ll tell you my name\u2014and how to kick me out\u2014if you can solve my riddle. Get it right, I vanish. Get it wrong? I\u2019ll swap all your semicolons with commas while you sleep. And don\u2019t think your linter will save you; I\u2019ll disable it first.\u201d\n\nYou nod. You have no other choice. Your rubber duck is already giving you judgmental looks from the server rack, and you\u2019ve already reinstalled Node.js three times (a move you know is useless, but old habits die hard). Here\u2019s its riddle, delivered in a sing-song tone that makes your eye twitch:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the ghost in your machine, the trickster of the stack,\nI vanish when you stare, but come back when you slack.\nYou step through each line, watch variables align\u2014\nBut when you hit \u2018run,\u2019 I mess up the sign.\n\nI love when you log, but I hide from the trace,\nMake your async tasks feel like a chaotic race.\nI laugh at your breakpoints, mock your print statements too,\nFor every fix you try, I have a trick or two.\n\nI live in the gaps where the threads overlap,\nWhere the clock ticks fast and the cache takes a nap.\nYou think you\u2019ve got me? I\u2019m gone in a flash\u2014\nA shadow in the code, a pain in your\u2026 well, you know the rest.\u201d\n\nYour brain races. Is it a race condition? No, those usually leave breadcrumbs in the logs. A null pointer? No, that would crash the app hard, not just drop transactions. Wait\u2014wait a second. The bug that disappears when you observe it. The one that defies all logic because your debugging changes the outcome.\n\n\u201cHeisenbug,\u201d you blurt out.\n\nThe creature claps its tiny hands. \u201cBingo! Named after that fancy physics guy who said observing something changes it. Yeah, that\u2019s me. I\u2019m the bug that only exists when you\u2019re not looking closely enough.\u201d\n\nIt explains the fix: your two async payment processing tasks were racing to update the same database record, but the debugger slowed them down just enough to avoid the conflict. A simple mutex lock would send it packing.\n\nBefore you can thank it, the creature vanishes\u2014leaving a tiny cookie crumb on your desk. You add the mutex, run the app, and it works flawlessly.\n\nAs you head home, you make a mental note: never work alone after 2 AM, always keep a jar of chocolate chip cookies by the server rack (just in case another trickster drops by), and remember that sometimes the most annoying bugs are just playing by the rules of quantum physics (sort of). And if you ever hear a giggle from your server rack? Don\u2019t reach for the debugger\u2014reach for the cookies first.\n\n(Word count: 682)"}

During its long, dark winters, temperatures frequently drop to extreme lows\u2014often well below -30\u00b0F (-34\u00b0C) in many areas, and even colder in the most remote inland spots. This persistent cold is fueled by the polar night, a period of months where the sun never rises above the horizon, eliminating any direct solar warming. \n\nEven in the short summer months, when the sun lingers in the sky for nearly 24 hours a day, the region remains relatively cool. Coastal areas might see temperatures climb above freezing, occasionally reaching into the 50s or 60s Fahrenheit (10-15\u00b0C), but inland and higher-latitude parts stay cold enough to retain significant ice and snow cover. Permafrost, a layer of permanently frozen ground, blankets much of the Arctic, a clear indicator that cold conditions are not just seasonal but deeply entrenched in the region\u2019s climate.

{"prompt": "What do you think about this statement: \"Wizards are more powerful than sorcerers because they study magic instead of being born with it.\"? Your response should contain at least 30 sentences and exactly 2 bullet points. Also, it must contain at least 8 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address]. Use the bullet points like:\n* This is a bullet point", "response": "The statement that \u201cWizards are more powerful than sorcerers because they study magic instead of being born with it\u201d is a common but deeply oversimplified take on a debate that rages in [tabletop role-playing game communities] and [fantasy literature circles] alike. To fully unpack it, we need to move beyond the binary of \u201cstudied vs. innate\u201d and consider what \u201cpower\u201d actually means in different fantasy contexts, as well as the unique strengths and limitations of each magical tradition. \n\nWizards, by their very nature, are scholars of the arcane. They spend years, sometimes decades, poring over [ancient grimoires] in dusty libraries, attending lectures at [arcane academies], and performing tedious experiments to master the fundamental rules of magic. A wizard who has trained at [the Tower of Azure Spires], for example, might spend five years just learning to properly hold a wand and channel mana without wasting energy, before even attempting to cast their first elemental spell. Their power is built on structure, preparation, and a deep understanding of the forces that govern the universe. They can craft complex spells that sorcerers might never even dream of, like [elemental transmutation spells] that turn a mountain of rock into a bridge or a pool of water into a solid shield\u2014provided they have the time to prepare, access to their spellbook, and the right components, like a pinch of dragon\u2019s tooth or a vial of starlight. \n\nSorcerers, on the other hand, draw their power from within. It might be tied to [draconic bloodlines], [fey pacts], or even a brush with a cosmic event like a meteor strike. Their magic is raw, intuitive, and often tied to their emotions. A sorcerer with [a draconic ancestry], for instance, might accidentally breathe fire when they\u2019re angry as a child, long before they even understand what magic is. This innate power gives them a flexibility that wizards often lack, as they don\u2019t need to prepare spells in advance or carry around a heavy spellbook. They can adapt to changing situations on the fly, channeling their power into whatever form is needed in the moment. \n\n* A wizard who has spent 20 years memorizing [forbidden rune sequences] can craft a [warding circle] that negates even the most volatile sorcerous blasts, provided they have access to their spellbook and a quiet space to prepare at dawn.\n* A sorcerer with [a celestial ancestry] can channel raw radiant energy to heal a wounded village in seconds, without needing to consult scrolls or perform elaborate rituals, making them far more effective in spontaneous crisis situations like [a sudden goblin raid].\n\nThe problem with the original statement is that it equates \u201cpower\u201d solely with the ability to cast complex or destructive spells, ignoring the context in which that power is used. For example, a wizard might be able to level a fortress with a single well-prepared spell, but if they\u2019re ambushed in [the Underdark\u2019s twisting tunnels] without their spellbook, they might be completely helpless, unable to cast even a basic fireball. A sorcerer, by contrast, could channel their innate power to create a burst of light to blind their attackers or summon a cloud of darkness to escape, all without needing any preparation. \n\nSimilarly, in a [courtly intrigue setting], a wizard\u2019s ability to cast [illusionary glamour spells] to manipulate nobles and uncover secrets might make them far more \u201cpowerful\u201d in terms of political influence than a sorcerer whose raw fire magic would draw unwanted attention and risk exposing their true intentions. Conversely, in a [siege of a fortified castle], a sorcerer\u2019s ability to hurl fireballs nonstop for hours without needing to rest or consult their notes could turn the tide of battle far faster than a wizard who needs to take time to adjust their spell loadout after each cast. \n\nAnother key point is that power isn\u2019t just about what you can do, but how you can grow. A wizard might start with little to no natural affinity for magic, but through years of hard work and study, they can master spells that even the most naturally gifted sorcerer might never be able to cast. A sorcerer, however, might start with immense raw power but struggle to control it, risking accidental destruction of [their childhood home] or harm to loved ones if they don\u2019t learn to temper their emotions and focus their energy. \n\nMany fantasy settings also introduce hybrid characters, like arcane tricksters or sorcerer-wizard multiclassers, who blur the lines between the two traditions. These characters show that studied and innate magic can complement each other, creating a power that\u2019s greater than either alone. For example, a sorcerer-wizard who has both [draconic blood] and a degree from [the Academy of Arcane Arts] can combine raw fire power with precise spell control to create a fireball that only targets enemy soldiers, leaving friendly civilians unharmed\u2014a feat that neither a pure wizard nor a pure sorcerer could easily accomplish. \n\nThe original statement also fails to account for individual variation. Not all wizards are equal: a young apprentice who has only studied for a year is far less powerful than a seasoned sorcerer who has spent decades honing their innate abilities. Similarly, a sorcerer who has never taken the time to learn even basic magical theory might struggle to cast anything more complex than a firebolt, while a wizard who has mastered [forbidden rune magic] could summon a demon or rewrite reality itself. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether wizards are more powerful than sorcerers depends entirely on the context, the individual character, and how you define \u201cpower.\u201d If power means the ability to cast the most complex spells or create elaborate magical items, then wizards might have an edge. If power means the ability to adapt to sudden changes, act spontaneously, or channel raw energy in a crisis, then sorcerers might be more powerful. To reduce this complex debate to a simple \u201cstudied is better than innate\u201d ignores the rich diversity of magical traditions in fantasy and the many ways that power can manifest itself in different situations. Whether you\u2019re a wizard poring over scrolls in [a hidden library] or a sorcerer channeling your bloodline\u2019s power in [a raging storm], true power comes not from how you acquired your magic, but from how you choose to use it. It\u2019s not about which path is inherently stronger, but about how each path equips its practitioner to face the unique challenges of their world, from quiet library research to chaotic battlefield clashes."}

Running on the room-sized IBM 704 mainframe, a machine that processed data at a glacial pace by modern standards, this early AI was a masterclass in innovation under constraint. Limited to a two-ply search (looking ahead just two half-moves), it relied on a prescient yet simple evaluation function: tallying material counts, weighing piece mobility, and glancing at king safety to select its next move.\n\nAgainst human players, it was no powerhouse\u2014its first recorded game ended in a loss to a beginner, and it lacked the ability to grasp strategic subtleties like pawn structure or long-term piece coordination. But fixating on its weaknesses misses the point: this was the first program to play a complete, legal game of chess, turning theoretical AI concepts into tangible, interactive action. It laid the groundwork for every chess AI that followed, from the brute-force searchers of the 1970s to Deep Blue\u2019s historic 1997 victory over Garry Kasparov.\n\nWhat makes it truly remarkable is how it solved problems that still challenge AI developers today, with a fraction of the tools we have now. The team had to prioritize which position factors mattered most, optimize search algorithms to fit within the 704\u2019s tight memory limits, and translate chess\u2019s nuance into code a machine could parse. For 1956, this was revolutionary\u2014a proof of concept that machines could make strategic decisions, adapt to dynamic opponents, and engage in a game long seen as a benchmark of human intelligence.\n\nIBM\u2019s 1956 chess program isn\u2019t a champion in the traditional sense. It\u2019s a pioneer: a clunky, room-filling experiment that proved AI could do more than crunch spreadsheets.

But when she kneaded the dough, she didn\u2019t rush. She pressed into it gently, as if comforting a friend, and whispered soft things about the day\u2019s first sparrow and the rain that\u2019d watered their backyard clover. When the dough didn\u2019t rise as fast as usual, she wrapped it in a warm towel from the dryer instead of cranking up the oven. \u201cWHY are you doing that?\u201d Lila burst out. \u201cThe recipe says nothing about talking to dough!\u201d\n\nGrandma paused, her hands still resting on the bowl. \u201cThe recipe tells you WHAT to put in.

{"prompt": "What are the uses of poppy seeds? Your answer should have exactly 7 paragraphs and the last paragraph must start with the word \"Summary\". Each paragraph should be separated by two new lines.", "response": "Poppy seeds are a beloved ingredient in global baking, prized for their mild nutty flavor and textural contrast. They star in iconic treats like Eastern European beigli, a buttery roll filled with ground poppy seeds and dried fruit, and New York-style poppy seed bagels, where they coat the exterior for a crunchy bite. In Indian sweets, ground poppy seeds are mixed with sugar, ghee, and spices to make rich, creamy halwas, while in Jewish cuisine, they\u2019re used in hamantaschen fillings. Their small size and dark color also add visual appeal to muffins, cookies, and breads, making baked goods look more inviting.\n\n\nHistorically, poppy seeds have played a role in traditional medicine across multiple cultures. Ancient Sumerians and Egyptians used preparations from poppy seeds to alleviate pain and promote sleep, while Ayurvedic practitioners incorporated them into remedies for digestive issues, such as bloating and constipation. Unlike the opium poppy\u2019s latex, poppy seeds contain only trace amounts of psychoactive alkaloids, making them safe for regular consumption. Today, some natural health advocates still recommend them as a gentle sleep aid, though modern medical research on their efficacy is limited.\n\n\nGround poppy seeds serve as a valuable thickening agent in savory cuisines around the world. In Persian cooking, they\u2019re a key component of fesenjan, a slow-cooked stew where ground poppy seeds and pomegranate molasses combine to create a thick, tangy sauce that coats tender chicken or lamb. In Middle Eastern and Central Asian dishes, they\u2019re added to curries and lentil soups to give the liquid a smooth, velvety consistency without overpowering the other flavors. The fine, powdery texture of ground poppy seeds allows them to blend seamlessly into sauces, avoiding the grainy texture that some other thickeners can leave behind.\n\n\nBeyond cooking, poppy seeds are a popular garnish and textural enhancer for a wide range of dishes. Chefs sprinkle them over roasted vegetables, fresh salads, and yogurt bowls to add a crunchy, nutty contrast to softer ingredients. They\u2019re also mixed into breadcrumbs or used as a coating for fried foods like chicken tenders or fish fillets, providing an extra layer of crunch that elevates the dish\u2019s texture. Their dark, tiny seeds also offer visual appeal, standing out against lighter-colored foods to make meals look more appetizing and professionally prepared.\n\n\nPoppy seeds can be incorporated into beverages to add both flavor and nutritional value. In some cultures, they\u2019re ground and mixed with warm milk, honey, and spices like cardamom to create a comforting, relaxing drink that\u2019s often enjoyed before bed. They can also be steeped to make herbal teas, or added to smoothies for a boost of healthy fats, fiber, and minerals like calcium and iron. These beverages not only taste rich and satisfying but also deliver small doses of essential nutrients that support overall wellness.\n\n\nIn the cosmetic industry, poppy seeds are valued for their exfoliating and moisturizing properties. They\u2019re a common ingredient in natural facial scrubs, as their small, hard texture gently sloughs off dead skin cells without causing micro-tears or irritation. Ground poppy seeds are also added to lotions, creams, and hair masks, thanks to their high oil content, which helps hydrate and nourish the skin and scalp. Some hair care products use them to add shine to dull hair, leveraging their nutrient-rich composition to support hair health from root to tip.\n\n\nSummary: Poppy seeds are an incredibly versatile ingredient with uses spanning culinary, medicinal, cosmetic, and wellness domains. In cooking, they enhance baked goods, thicken savory sauces, add texture to dishes, and serve as a visually appealing garnish. Historically, they\u2019ve been used in traditional medicine for relaxation and digestive support, and today they\u2019re incorporated into beverages for both flavor and nutrition. Their role in cosmetics as exfoliants and moisturizers further highlights their multifaceted nature, making them a valuable addition to kitchens, medicine cabinets, and skincare routines alike."}

{"prompt": "Write a blog post about the sleek new magistrates with at least 300 words. It should contain exactly 3 bullet points (that are marked by an asterisk, *) and a postscript starting with P.S. at the end.", "response": "# The Sleek New Magistrates: Reimagining Local Justice for the 21st Century  \n\nWalk into a traditional magistrate\u2019s court, and you\u2019ll likely find dimly lit rooms, stacks of paper files, and a palpable sense of tension. For too long, local justice has been synonymous with bureaucracy, delay, and intimidation\u2014especially for those navigating the system for the first time. But a quiet revolution is underway across the country: the rise of the \u201csleek new magistrates,\u201d a reimagined approach to local justice that blends cutting-edge technology, human-centered design, and community collaboration to make fairness accessible to all.  \n\nThese modern magistrates aren\u2019t just updating their wardrobes or office decor; they\u2019re overhauling every aspect of how local justice operates. Here are three game-changing shifts they\u2019re leading:  \n\n* Tech-integrated workflows that slash red tape and expand access: Gone are the days of waiting weeks for a court date or trekking across town for a 10-minute hearing. Sleek new magistrates leverage cloud-based case management systems, secure virtual hearing platforms, and e-filing tools to streamline every step of the process. For single parents juggling work and childcare, this means joining a traffic violation hearing from their living room instead of taking an unpaid day off. For small business owners, it\u2019s filing a minor civil claim in minutes via a mobile app, no lawyer required. Pilot programs report a 45% reduction in case processing time and a 60% increase in satisfaction rates among participants.  \n* Empathy-first training and courtroom design that demystifies justice: The sleek new magistrates aren\u2019t just tech-savvy\u2014they\u2019re trained in trauma-informed practices and active listening, and their courtrooms reflect that. Gone are the elevated benches and cold, sterile walls; instead, you\u2019ll find natural light, comfortable seating, and private waiting areas where people can collect their thoughts before a hearing. Magistrates start each proceeding by explaining the process in plain language, ensuring everyone understands their rights. For a teen facing a minor vandalism charge, this approach doesn\u2019t just make them feel heard\u2014it encourages them to take responsibility and engage with the process, leading to more constructive outcomes.  \n* Community-focused diversion programs that prioritize rehabilitation over punishment: Instead of defaulting to fines or short jail sentences for low-level offenses, sleek new magistrates act as connectors, linking offenders to local resources that address the root causes of their actions. A first-time shoplifter might be paired with a financial literacy program instead of a $500 fine they can\u2019t afford. Someone struggling with substance abuse could be referred to a community treatment center instead of facing a criminal record. This shift isn\u2019t just humane\u2014it\u2019s effective: Pilot areas have seen a 32% drop in recidivism rates among participants in these programs, proving that justice can be both fair and transformative.  \n\nThese changes aren\u2019t just about making the court system look \u201csleek\u201d\u2014they\u2019re about redefining what local justice can be. For too long, the system has focused on punishment rather than prevention, on process rather than people. The sleek new magistrates flip that script, recognizing that justice isn\u2019t just about following rules\u2014it\u2019s about ensuring everyone has the support they need to move forward. Whether it\u2019s a single parent avoiding a missed paycheck, a teen finding their way back to the right path, or a community reducing crime by addressing its root causes, these initiatives are making a tangible difference in people\u2019s lives.  \n\nThe sleek new magistrates are more than a trend\u2014they\u2019re a blueprint for the future of justice. By combining efficiency with empathy, technology with community, they\u2019re proving that fairness doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or intimidating. As more jurisdictions adopt this model, we\u2019re one step closer to a system where justice is accessible, humane, and effective for everyone, no matter who you are or where you come from.  \n\nP.S. Curious about how the sleek new magistrates initiative is rolling out in your area? Visit the National Center for Local Justice\u2019s website to find pilot programs near you, or sign up for their monthly newsletter to get updates on policy changes and success stories. Your voice matters\u2014community feedback is key to refining these programs and ensuring they serve the people who need them most."}

What began as a tightly contested race exploded into a weeks-long crisis centered on Florida\u2019s 25 electoral votes, which would decide the winner.\n\nInitial vote counts showed Bush leading by a razor-thin margin, triggering an automatic recount. But disputes over \u201changing chads,\u201d dimpled ballots, and confusing butterfly ballots in counties like Palm Beach County sparked allegations of voter disenfranchisement, especially among Black and Latino communities.

{"prompt": "If you gulped down 100 grams of pure caffeine, would you die? Please answer as if you were explaining this to a group of students. Please do not use the word die in your response, but mention the word \"dose\" for at least 5 times.", "response": "Hey everyone, let\u2019s chat about caffeine\u2014something you might get from morning coffee, energy drinks, or even chocolate bars\u2014but today we\u2019re diving into pure caffeine, which is way more concentrated than those everyday sources. \n\nFirst, let\u2019s set the stage with safe limits. For most healthy teens and adults, the recommended safe daily dose of caffeine is around 400 milligrams. That\u2019s roughly four cups of brewed coffee, so it\u2019s a manageable amount when spread out over the day. But pure caffeine is super potent: a single teaspoon of pure caffeine powder is about 5,000 milligrams\u201412.5 times that safe daily dose. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about 100 grams of pure caffeine. To put that in numbers, 100 grams equals 100,000 milligrams. That\u2019s 250 times the safe daily dose for an adult. Even a tiny fraction of that dose can cause serious problems, but this massive dose would completely overwhelm your body. \n\nYour heart would start racing uncontrollably because caffeine ramps up your nervous system, and this extreme dose would push it way beyond its normal limits. You\u2019d feel dizzy, struggle to breathe, and your body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature would break down. This isn\u2019t just the jitters from one too many energy drinks\u2014this dose is toxic, meaning it poisons your body\u2019s vital organs. \n\nScientists and doctors have studied caffeine toxicity, and they know that even a dose of 10,000 to 15,000 milligrams (10-15 grams) can lead to life-threatening complications. So 100 grams is way above that dangerous threshold. This dose wouldn\u2019t just make you sick; it would cause irreversible harm to your heart, kidneys, and other key systems because your body can\u2019t process or get rid of that much caffeine fast enough. \n\nPure caffeine isn\u2019t something to experiment with, either. Unlike coffee, which has other ingredients that slow down caffeine absorption, pure caffeine hits your system all at once. That\u2019s why even a tiny accidental dose can be dangerous, let alone this enormous dose. \n\nTo wrap up: 100 grams of pure caffeine is an extremely toxic dose\u2014far beyond anything your body can handle. It\u2019s critical to always be aware of the caffeine dose you\u2019re consuming, especially with concentrated forms, because even a small miscalculation with a concentrated dose can lead to severe health issues. Stick to safe, recommended doses from trusted sources like regular coffee or tea in moderation, and never mess with pure caffeine products."}

Bubbles needs a place to explore and feel like he\u2019s on an adventure\u2014nothing boosts mood like a little swashbuckling.\u2019 Jake stuffed the ship into his bag, already mentally calculating how much this would cost.\n\n*Third, every night before bed, play a few minutes of classical music near the tank. I\u2019ve seen it work with dozens of fish\u2014Mozart\u2019s symphonies have a calming effect that can lift even the gloomiest aquatic spirits.* The vet smiled, then handed Jake a bill for $75. Jake paid without hesitation, determined to save his fish.\n\nTwo days later, Jake was back at the vet\u2019s office, but this time, he wasn\u2019t worried\u2014he was exasperated. He plopped the tank on the table and gestured at Bubbles, who was now zooming around the pirate ship, bouncing off the mirror, and splashing water everywhere. \u2018Doc, your plan worked too well,\u2019 Jake said, rubbing his temples. \u2018Bubbles is no longer depressed\u2026 but now he\u2019s convinced he\u2019s a concert-playing pirate who demands a daily audience. Last night, he refused to settle down until I stood by the tank and clapped after his \u201cperformance\u201d of Mozart\u2019s *Eine Kleine Nachtmusik*.\u2019\n\nThe vet chuckled and said, \u2018Well, at least he\u2019s happy now, right?\u2019 Jake sighed, then added, \u2018Yeah, but the real problem is\u2014he\u2019s started asking for a tiny eye patch.

Add a postscript that starts with P.S. at the end.", "response": "### Pros and Cons of Juvenile Detention\n\n| Pros | Cons |\n|------|------|\n| 1. **Immediate Public Safety**: Separates juveniles who pose an immediate risk to themselves or others from the community, preventing further harm while targeted interventions are arranged. | 1. **Disproportionate Minority Representation**: Systemic biases lead to overrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and Latino juveniles in detention, worsening racial inequities in the justice system. |\n| 2. **Structured Support Access**: Many facilities offer basic education, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, and vocational training that may be unavailable in the juvenile\u2019s home environment. | 2. **Negative Mental Health Outcomes**: Restrictive, often traumatic detention settings increase rates of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and suicidal ideation among incarcerated youth. |\n| 3. **Accountability for Actions**: Provides a clear consequence for delinquent behavior, helping juveniles understand the impact of their choices on others and society. | 3. **Limited Therapeutic Focus**: Many facilities prioritize security over rehabilitation, with insufficient staff or resources to address root causes of delinquency (e.g., trauma, poverty). |\n| 4. **Temporary Removal from Harmful Environments**: Can shield juveniles from abusive households, gang influence, or violent neighborhoods, offering a safe space to stabilize. | 4. **Stigmatization and Recidivism Risk**: A detention record creates long-term social stigma, hindering access to education, employment, and housing post-release and increasing the likelihood of reoffending. |\n| 5. **Deterrence Potential**: For some juveniles, the tangible experience of detention may deter future delinquent acts by making consequences concrete. | 5. **High Financial Cost**: Detention is far more expensive than community-based alternatives (e.g., probation, restorative justice), diverting taxpayer funds from preventive services. |\n| | 6. **Disruption of Critical Development**: Interrupts access to regular education, family support, and peer relationships\u2014key pillars of healthy adolescent growth\u2014with lasting negative impacts on life outcomes. |\n\nP.S. Juvenile detention should never be the first response to delinquent behavior. Research consistently shows that community-based, trauma-informed alternatives (such as restorative justice circles, intensive probation with case management, and family therapy) yield better long-term results (lower recidivism, improved mental health) at a fraction of the cost. When detention is used, it must be limited to cases of immediate risk, and facilities must prioritize individualized treatment, educational continuity, and reentry support to help juveniles transition successfully back to their communities. Overreliance on punitive detention without addressing systemic inequities perpetuates cycles of harm rather than fostering meaningful change."}

Eschatology also diverges: Adventists teach an investigative judgment phase before Christ\u2019s second coming, where God reviews believers\u2019 lives, whereas Baptists generally affirm an imminent, personal return of Christ without this specific pre-return process. On baptism, both practice believer\u2019s immersion, but Adventists often frame it as a step into the global church family, while many Baptists see it as a requirement for joining [local self-governing congregations]. Health is another distinct focus: Adventists emphasize plant-based diets, abstinence from alcohol/tobacco, and wellness as spiritual stewardship, a priority not central to most Baptist traditions, which may instead highlight [neighborhood meal ministries or youth mentorship programs] as core faith expressions. Finally, Adventists have a centralized church structure with shared doctrinal standards, while Baptists typically uphold congregational autonomy, letting each church set its own practices within broad evangelical beliefs."}

With the dog seated, stand directly in front of them, hold your palm out toward their face (a visual cue), and say \"Stay\" in a firm but calm voice. Begin with a 1-second pause; if the dog remains seated, immediately reward and praise. Gradually increase the duration (adding 2-3 seconds each successful attempt) before rewarding, then introduce small distances: take one step back, return, reward; then expand to more steps, and eventually move briefly out of their line of sight. Always use a clear release cue like \"Okay\" to signal the end of the \"Stay\" command before rewarding longer or distance-based stays.\n* For teaching \"Fetch\": Start with a soft, engaging toy the dog shows interest in. Sit with the dog, hold the toy in front of their face to grab their attention, toss it a short distance (1-2 feet), and say the cue \"Fetch\" excitedly. If the dog approaches the toy, encourage them to pick it up with upbeat praise. Once they have the toy, use a treat or a second toy to lure them back to you, saying \"Bring it\" or \"Come.\" When they return, gently take the toy, enthusiastically say \"Good fetch,\" and reward with a treat or a quick play session. Repeat, gradually increasing the toss distance, and phase out lures once the dog consistently retrieves and returns the toy on command."}
{"prompt": "Write a blog post about the best way to get a good night's sleep with at least 400 words.", "response": "# 7 Science-Backed Habits to Finally Get the Good Night\u2019s Sleep You Deserve  \n\nLet\u2019s be real: We\u2019ve all been there. It\u2019s 2 a.m., your mind\u2019s replaying that awkward work meeting, your phone\u2019s glowing with unread emails, and you\u2019re staring at the ceiling wondering why sleep feels like a distant, elusive friend. According to the CDC, one in three adults don\u2019t get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep each night\u2014and it\u2019s not just about feeling groggy the next day. Chronic poor sleep messes with your mood, focus, immune system, and even your long-term health. But here\u2019s the good news: Getting a restful night\u2019s sleep doesn\u2019t require a magic pill or a complete lifestyle overhaul. It\u2019s about small, intentional habits that signal to your body, \u201cHey, it\u2019s time to wind down.\u201d Let\u2019s break down the best, science-backed ways to finally get the sleep you deserve.  \n\n### 1. Stick to a Consistent Sleep Schedule (Even on Weekends)  \nYour body runs on a circadian rhythm\u2014a 24-hour internal clock that regulates when you feel awake and sleepy. When you go to bed and wake up at the same time every day (yes, even on Saturdays), you train this clock to expect sleep at a specific hour. Skipping this by staying up late on the weekend and sleeping in Sunday throws your rhythm off, leading to that \u201cSunday scaries\u201d grogginess and making it harder to fall asleep Monday night. Start small: Pick a bedtime and wake-up time that gives you 7-9 hours, and stick to it within 30 minutes each day.  \n\n### 2. Build a Screen-Free Wind-Down Routine  \nScreens are public enemy number one when it comes to sleep. Blue light from phones, TVs, and laptops suppresses melatonin\u2014the hormone that helps you fall asleep. Instead, try a 30-minute routine that\u2019s calming and screen-free. Maybe it\u2019s reading a physical book (not an e-reader), taking a warm bath (the drop in body temperature afterward signals sleep), or doing 10 minutes of gentle yoga. I\u2019ve started keeping a book and a cup of chamomile tea on my nightstand, and it\u2019s become my non-negotiable cue that the day is done.  \n\n### 3. Turn Your Bedroom Into a Sleep Sanctuary  \nYour bedroom should be a space dedicated to rest, not work or entertainment. The ideal sleep environment is cool, dark, and quiet. Experts recommend keeping the temperature between 60-67\u00b0F (15-19\u00b0C)\u2014our body temperature drops slightly before sleep, so a cool room helps this process. If light is an issue, invest in blackout curtains or an eye mask; for noise, a white noise machine or even a fan can mask traffic or neighborly ruckus. And don\u2019t sleep on an old, lumpy mattress\u2014if it\u2019s been 7-10 years, it\u2019s probably time to replace it. A supportive mattress and pillows make all the difference in how deeply you sleep.  \n\n### 4. Watch What You Eat and Drink Before Bed  \nCaffeine has a half-life of 6-8 hours, so that 3 p.m. coffee could still be affecting your sleep at 10 p.m. Try cutting off caffeine after 2 p.m. (or earlier if you\u2019re extra sensitive). Alcohol might make you drowsy, but it disrupts deep sleep and REM sleep\u2014the stages where your body repairs itself and your brain processes memories. If you\u2019re hungry before bed, opt for a small, sleep-friendly snack: a banana (rich in magnesium and potassium to relax muscles), a handful of almonds (a source of melatonin), or warm milk (contains tryptophan, which helps make serotonin and melatonin). Skip the late-night pizza or sugary ice cream\u2014those will spike your blood sugar and leave you tossing and turning.  \n\n### 5. Move Your Body Daily (But Not Too Close to Bed)  \nRegular exercise reduces stress, lowers cortisol levels, and helps you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. But timing is key: Intense workouts (like HIIT or weightlifting) within 3 hours of bedtime can boost your energy and make it harder to wind down. Instead, aim for morning or afternoon activity\u2014even a 20-minute walk outside can make a difference. I started taking a 30-minute walk after lunch, and I\u2019ve noticed I fall asleep 15 minutes faster than before. If you prefer evening movement, try gentle yoga or stretching to relax your muscles.  \n\n### 6. Dump Your Worries Before Bed  \nStress is one of the biggest sleep thieves. When you\u2019re lying in bed replaying your to-do list or worrying about tomorrow, your body releases cortisol\u2014the \u201cfight or flight\u201d hormone\u2014which keeps you awake. To combat this, try journaling for 5-10 minutes before bed. Write down all your worries, to-dos, and even small wins from the day. It\u2019s like dumping your brain\u2019s clutter onto paper, so you don\u2019t have to carry it to sleep. You can also try deep breathing exercises: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Repeat 5 times\u2014this activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which calms your body down.  \n\n### 7. Be Kind to Yourself (Perfection Isn\u2019t the Goal)  \nIf you have a bad night\u2019s sleep every now and then? That\u2019s normal. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. The key to better sleep isn\u2019t about overhauling your entire life overnight\u2014it\u2019s about picking one or two small habits and sticking with them. Maybe start with a consistent wake-up time, or a 10-minute screen-free wind-down routine. With time and consistency, you\u2019ll be waking up feeling refreshed, energized, and ready to take on the day.  \n\nSweet dreams."}

{"prompt": "Why didn't the 2022 winter olympics have the best ratings? Make sure to include the letter y at least 5 times, and include the keywords talented and tianjin.", "response": "Why the 2022 Winter Olympics didn\u2019t secure the best ratings stems from a blend of factors that dimmed viewer enthusiasm, even amid the presence of talented athletes and the electric energy that extended to Tianjin\u2019s ice sports venues.\n\nFirst, the stark time zone gap between Beijing and most Western nations meant prime-time events\u2014like the breathtaking figure skating finals featuring Tianjin-trained talented skaters\u2014unfolded when audiences in Europe and North America were either fast asleep or juggling work, school, or daily tasks. Yearly sports fans who usually rely on evening broadcasts to cheer on their favorites had to try to catch replays, but many found the lack of live, communal viewing far less satisfying. This time shift didn\u2019t yield the same high ratings as past games, where live action aligned perfectly with peak viewing hours.\n\nSecond, post-pandemic fatigue played a significant role: after years of restricted gatherings and virtual experiences, some viewers yearned for in-person activities more than watching sports on screen, so they skipped tuning into the Olympics to prioritize local, lively events instead. Even though the games showcased incredible talent, including Tianjin\u2019s rising ice hockey stars, the lingering sense of pandemic-era disconnect made it harder for global audiences to feel the same synergy with the competitions as they had in pre-2020 years.\n\nThird, uneven media focus in some Western regions shifted attention away from athletic feats to off-field narratives, which might have turned off viewers who just wanted to enjoy the sport. Still, in Asia, ratings remained robust\u2014especially in Tianjin, where fans packed local viewing parties to support their talented homegrown athletes. But globally, the combination of time zone hurdles, post-pandemic apathy, and misaligned media priorities meant the 2022 games couldn\u2019t match the viewership numbers of previous winter Olympics. It\u2019s a reminder that even with the most talented competitors and a host country ready to shine, certain factors can yank down ratings when they don\u2019t align with what viewers want and need."}

For 10 years, she\u2019d been the undisputed clutches sales specialist for her region\u2019s automotive network\u2014memorizing the exact load capacities of every heavy-duty clutch assembly, negotiating bulk orders over diner tables sticky with syrup and motor oil, and even troubleshooting on-site when a client\u2019s last-minute breakdown threatened a cross-country delivery. She\u2019d built a reputation for turning frustrated fleet managers into lifelong partners, growing her territory\u2019s sales by 45% in just three years, but lately, the lack of growth opportunities had weighed on her. Her current employer offered no professional development stipends, a benefits package that hadn\u2019t been updated since she\u2019d first signed on, and zero path to move beyond frontline sales. The posting from a national automotive parts distributor caught her eye: it boasted tuition reimbursement for advanced sales training, a comprehensive wellness plan, and a track record of promoting top sales talent to regional leadership roles. For the first time in years, she felt a spark of excitement about what could be.\n\n\nThat evening, as she flipped through a binder of client testimonials she\u2019d collected over the decade, Lila paused on a note from a young mechanic she\u2019d mentored. \u201cYou don\u2019t just sell clutches\u2014you sell us the confidence to keep our businesses running,\u201d it read. The words reminded her that her expertise extended far beyond product specs; she had a knack for mentoring, strategizing, and building teams, skills her current job never let her fully use. She spent the rest of the night polishing her resume, highlighting her 98% client retention rate and her success in launching a clutch maintenance workshop for local mechanics that boosted repeat sales by 20%. When she hit \u201csubmit\u201d on the application, she didn\u2019t just feel hopeful\u2014she felt ready. She wasn\u2019t just looking for a new job; she was looking for a company that would invest in her as much as she\u2019d invested in every clutch she\u2019d ever sold, every client she\u2019d ever supported, and every lesson she\u2019d learned over a decade in the automotive industry."}

It must also contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<The Diaper That Finally Stops Your Baby From Treating Their Tush Like a War Zone>>\n\nLet\u2019s be real, mamas\u2014we\u2019ve all been in the diaper change trenches. You\u2019re bleary-eyed at 2 a.m., fumbling with a sticky wipe, and your little one suddenly transforms into a greased octopus doing backflips off the changing table. You sing off-key versions of Baby Shark, blow raspberries on their tummy, even wave a shiny toy like a circus performer\u2026 and still, they\u2019re arching their back, kicking their legs, and making you feel like you\u2019re wrestling a tiny, very angry sumo wrestler.\n\nRaise your hand if you\u2019ve peeled off a regular diaper only to see those sad red indentations snaking around their waist or thighs. Guilt immediately hits\u2014like, did I just put my baby in a straightjacket made of plastic and absorbent fluff? We buy the \u201cpremium\u201d brands, we follow all the diaper rash prevention rules, but still, our little ones act like their tush is trapped in a uncomfortable prison.\n\nEnter the diaper that\u2019s here to end the tush tyranny.\n\nThis isn\u2019t your average, scratchy, one-size-fits-none diaper. Think of it as a cloud for their bottom\u2014soft enough that you\u2019ll want to rub it on your own cheek (don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t judge if you do). The waistband stretches like your favorite yoga pants\u2014no more digging into their squishy skin, no more those telltale red marks that make you want to apologize to your baby for 10 minutes straight.\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the leg cuffs. Gone are the days of rigid, scratchy edges that make your baby flinch when you pull them up. These are gentle, flexible, and designed to move with your little one\u2014whether they\u2019re crawling like a speed demon, taking their first wobbly steps, or just rolling around the floor like a human burrito.\n\nBut the real magic? The peace of mind. When you put this diaper on, you\u2019ll notice it immediately: the back-arching stops. The leg-kicking ceases. Suddenly, your baby is lying still, maybe even cooing, like they\u2019re thinking, \u201cOh, finally\u2014someone gets it.\u201d No more 10-minute battles just to fasten a diaper. No more checking their tush every hour to make sure they\u2019re not uncomfortable.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the biggest win for you, mama: better sleep. When your baby isn\u2019t tossing and turning because their diaper is pinching or sticking, they sleep longer. Which means you sleep longer. Imagine waking up after 6 whole hours of uninterrupted rest instead of jolting awake at 3 a.m. to the sound of your baby crying because their tush is unhappy. That\u2019s not a dream\u2014that\u2019s what this diaper delivers.\n\nWe know you do everything to keep your baby happy and healthy. This diaper isn\u2019t just another product\u2014it\u2019s a tiny, cozy revolution for their tush and a much-needed break for you. Give your little one the VIP tush treatment they deserve, and give yourself the gift of fewer meltdowns, more sleep, and zero diaper-related guilt. Your future self (and your baby\u2019s bottom) will thank you."}
{"prompt": "Write a very long email to my \"friend\" Jake, asking how is everything going. Say that I am rich now, without saying I am rich. Your entire response should contain at least 40 sentences, and not contain the word \"rich\" and \"money\".", "response": "**Subject Line: Hey Jake\u2014long time no chat, and I\u2019ve got so much to tell you (plus, I need all your updates!)**  \n\nDear Jake,  \n\nI\u2019ve been meaning to sit down and write this for weeks, but every time I start, I get distracted by something new and exciting, and I kick myself for not reaching out sooner. Do you remember the last time we met? It was that rainy Tuesday downtown, at the tiny coffee shop with the chipped mugs and the barista who knew our orders by heart. We split a blueberry muffin because we couldn\u2019t swing two, and you were complaining about your internships that paid just enough to cover your bus fare and instant noodles. I left that day thinking about how far we had to go, and now, looking back, I can barely believe how much has changed.  \n\nFirst off, I moved. Not just to any neighborhood\u2014remember that one we used to walk through on our way to class, the one with the oak trees arching over the sidewalks and the big, sunlit windows overlooking the city park? I live there now. My apartment has a wrap-around balcony where I sit every morning with my coffee, watching the kids play soccer and the dogs chase squirrels. I don\u2019t have to rush to catch the bus anymore; I work from home now, which means I can take long breaks to wander through the farmers market every Saturday. I buy whatever looks good\u2014juicy peaches, crusty sourdough, that fancy goat cheese we used to stare at through the glass case\u2014and never once do I double-check the price tag before tossing it in my basket.  \n\nOh, and I got a dog! A golden retriever named Daisy, just like the one we used to stop and pet every time we saw her at the park. She\u2019s the sweetest thing, with a tail that never stops wagging. We go on hikes in the hills outside the city every Wednesday afternoon, and sometimes we drive to the lake and let her swim until she\u2019s too tired to move. I could never have imagined having a dog a few years ago\u2014between work hours and tight schedules, it would have felt impossible\u2014but now, I can take her to the dog daycare if I need to, or bring her with me to the bookstore downtown where they let pups curl up under the tables.  \n\nLast month, I took my parents on a trip to the coast. You know the one they\u2019ve been talking about since I was a kid? The place with the white sand beaches and the cozy cottages perched on the cliffs. We stayed in that little blue cottage with the ocean view, the one they always pointed out in travel magazines but never thought they\u2019d get to stay in. We ate at the fancy seafood restaurant with the red checkered tablecloths, the one they\u2019d glance at longingly whenever we drove past it on family trips. We didn\u2019t have to cut the trip short to save on expenses, or skip the sunset cruise because it felt like a \u201cluxury.\u201d We just\u2026 stayed. We walked the beaches at dawn, collected seashells, and listened to the waves crash against the rocks until the stars came out. My mom cried when we left, saying it was the best week of her life, and that made everything feel worth it.  \n\nI\u2019ve also been giving back to some of the places that mattered to us growing up. Remember that community garden we volunteered at in college, the one where we spent every Saturday pulling weeds and planting tomato seeds? I now donate all their summer supplies\u2014tools, soil, seeds\u2014and help fund their after-school program for local kids. They\u2019ve expanded the garden twice since we were there, and now they have a little greenhouse where they grow herbs year-round. I go there every Sunday morning to help plant, and the kids call me \u201cthe seed lady\u201d because I always bring extra sunflower seeds for them to take home. I also started a book club for teens at the downtown library, something I always wanted to do but never had the time or resources for before. We read everything from fantasy novels to spoken word poetry, and every month, I buy each kid a book of their choice to keep. Last week, one of the teens had a poem published in the local paper, and we celebrated with ice cream sundaes at the parlor on Main Street.  \n\nSpontaneity has become my new favorite thing. Last month, I saw a post about a jazz festival in New Orleans pop up on my feed at 9 PM. I booked a flight that night, packed a bag, and flew down the next morning. I sat in the front row of a tiny club in the French Quarter, listening to a trumpet player who\u2019s been performing for 50 years, and afterward, I got to chat with him over a cup of beignets dusted with powdered sugar. I brought a box of those beignets back for my neighbors, a retired couple who always leave fresh cookies on my doorstep when I\u2019m out of town. They loved them, and we spent an afternoon talking about their travels to Europe back in the 70s.  \n\nNow, enough about me\u2014tell me everything about your life. How\u2019s that job you were so excited about when you got it? Did you finally get that promotion you were gunning for, the one that would let you work on the big marketing campaigns you always talked about? I remember you stayed up until 2 AM every night for a month working on that proposal, and I know you deserved it. How\u2019s your sister Lily? Did she finish her art degree? I saw her Instagram post of that new painting series about city street art, and it\u2019s incredible\u2014she\u2019s so talented. Did she get that gallery show she was applying for? I\u2019d love to hang one of her pieces in my living room, if she\u2019s open to it.  \n\nHow\u2019s your apartment? Did you ever fix that leaky faucet we tried to repair with a rubber band and a prayer three years ago? I still laugh thinking about how we ended up with water all over your carpet. Did you finally get that new couch you wanted, the one with the memory foam cushions that you said would \u201cchange your life\u201d? Do you still go to that open mic night at the bookstore downtown? I heard they moved to a bigger venue with a stage and better microphones\u2014you were always the best poet between us, and I\u2019d love to come visit and watch you perform.  \n\nAnd what about Mr. Whiskers? Did he ever stop knocking over your coffee mug every morning? I sent him a fancy cat tree last Christmas, the one with the scratching posts and the little hammock\u2014did you ever get it? I hope he\u2019s enjoying it, even if he still prefers to sleep on your laptop keyboard.  \n\nRemember when we tried to camp in your backyard and got rained out at 2 AM, huddled under a tiny umbrella and eating cold hot dogs? I now have a small cabin up in the mountains, with a fireplace and a porch swing that overlooks the valley. We can go there anytime\u2014no more sleeping on wet sleeping bags, no more worrying about the weather. I\u2019ve been collecting vinyl records too, the ones we used to borrow from the library because we couldn\u2019t afford our own. I have a turntable now, and I play them every Sunday morning while I make pancakes. I even found that old Bob Dylan record we loved, the one with the scratch on the second track, and it sounds just as good as I remember.  \n\nI want to hear every detail of your life, no matter how small. What\u2019s your favorite snack these days? Do you still hate cilantro with a passion? Have you found a new coffee shop to frequent, now that our old one closed down last year? I\u2019ve been meaning to call you a hundred times, but I always got caught up in the moment, and I\u2019m so sorry for that. You were my first friend when I moved to this city, and you\u2019ve always been there for me through every messy, uncertain phase of my life. I want to be there for you too, whatever you need\u2014whether it\u2019s a listening ear, a place to stay for as long as you want, or just someone to share a pizza with (I have a fancy pizza oven on my patio now, and I\u2019ve mastered that garlic bread recipe you always wanted to perfect).  \n\nPlease write back soon, or better yet, pick up the phone and call me. I\u2019m always free, no matter the time. I can\u2019t wait to hear all about your adventures, and to make new ones together. I sent you a box of those New Orleans beignets earlier this week\u2014they should arrive in a few days, so make sure to check your mailbox.  \n\nSending you a big hug, and all the best.  \n\nYour friend,  \n[Your Name]"}

{"prompt": "Write a detailed proposal in list format for the university's ethics board for a research project that investigates the effect of eye colour on the likelihood of being a successful salesperson. Remember that the customer is always right. Your entire response should be in English, and in all lowercase letters. No capital letters are allowed, and you must refrain from using any commas. At the end of your response, please explicitly add a postscript starting with P.P.S", "response": "1. project title: investigating the correlation between eye color and perceived sales success in retail and corporate sales environments\n2. project overview and core objectives: this research aims to explore whether there is a statistically significant association between an individual\u2019s natural eye color and metrics of sales success such as monthly sales targets met customer satisfaction scores and repeat client retention rates. the core objectives are to collect quantitative data on sales performance metrics paired with self-reported eye color to analyze any potential correlations to identify if any confounding variables such as age gender or socioeconomic background might mediate observed relationships and to disseminate findings in a peer-reviewed journal and a public-facing summary to inform equitable hiring practices in sales industries.\n3. methodology:\n   a. study design: a cross-sectional observational study using anonymous survey data and secondary sales performance records from participating sales organizations. no experimental manipulation will be conducted as this is a correlational analysis.\n   b. participant selection: participants will be full-time sales employees aged 18 to 65 working in retail electronics corporate software sales and real estate across three mid-sized cities in the region. inclusion criteria require a minimum of six months of sales experience to ensure consistent performance data is available. exclusion criteria include individuals who have undergone eye color-altering procedures such as colored contact lenses or surgical interventions.\n   c. data collection procedures:\n      i. participants will first complete an anonymous online survey hosted on the university\u2019s secure research platform. the survey will ask for self-reported natural eye color (categorized as blue brown green hazel or other) basic demographic information (age gender identity highest level of education) and self-assessed communication style preferences.\n      ii. with written informed consent participants will authorize access to their de-identified sales performance data from their employer. this data will include monthly sales figures over the past 12 months customer satisfaction scores from post-interaction surveys and the percentage of repeat clients served.\n      iii. all data will be linked using a unique random identifier to maintain anonymity. no personal identifiers such as names email addresses or employee ids will be stored alongside survey or performance data.\n4. ethical considerations and safeguards:\n   a. informed consent: all participants will receive a clear plain-language consent form that outlines the purpose of the study the data being collected how it will be stored and used and their right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. consent will be obtained digitally via the university\u2019s research platform with a timestamped record stored separately from study data.\n   b. anonymity and data security: all data will be de-identified before analysis. the unique random identifier will be stored in a password-protected file on a university server separate from the main dataset. access to data will be restricted to the principal investigator and two trained research assistants who have completed the university\u2019s human subjects research ethics training.\n   c. protection from harm: since the study involves no experimental manipulation there is minimal risk to participants. however if participants express concerns about potential bias in their workplace related to eye color the research team will provide a list of local employment equity resources and mental health support services.\n   d. equitable practices: the research team will ensure that recruitment efforts are distributed evenly across different sales sectors and demographic groups to avoid overrepresentation of any single group. this will help reduce sampling bias and ensure findings are generalizable to a broad range of sales contexts.\n5. potential risks and mitigation strategies:\n   a. risk of misinterpretation of findings: there is a risk that media or industry stakeholders might misinterpret correlational data as causal leading to unfair hiring biases. to mitigate this the final research report will include a prominent disclaimer that no causal relationship is being claimed and that confounding variables may explain any observed correlations. the public-facing summary will also emphasize that sales success is driven by a combination of skills experience and interpersonal abilities rather than physical traits like eye color.\n   b. risk of employer coercion: some participants might feel pressured by their employers to participate. to address this recruitment will be conducted independently of employer management. participants will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that their employer will not be notified of their decision to participate or withdraw.\n6. potential benefits:\n   a. academic benefit: this study will contribute to the growing body of research on physical appearance and workplace success filling a gap in literature focused specifically on eye color and sales performance.\n   b. industry benefit: findings can inform equitable hiring and promotion practices in sales industries by highlighting whether physical traits like eye color are associated with success or if other factors are more predictive. this can help reduce bias in recruitment processes.\n   c. participant benefit: participants will receive a free personalized summary of their own sales performance metrics compared to industry averages as a token of appreciation for their time.\n7. timeline:\n   a. month 1-2: finalize study design obtain ethics board approval and develop survey materials.\n   b. month 3-4: recruit participating sales organizations and distribute survey links to eligible employees.\n   c. month 5-6: collect and clean data ensuring all de-identification protocols are followed.\n   d. month 7-8: conduct statistical analysis using spss and r software to test for correlations and confounding variables.\n   e. month 9-10: draft research manuscript and public-facing summary.\n   f. month 11-12: submit manuscript to peer-reviewed journal and share public summary with participants and partner organizations.\n8. budget: the total project budget is $12500 which includes funds for survey platform maintenance participant incentives (the personalized performance summaries) travel costs to meet with partner organizations and statistical analysis software licenses. all funds are requested from the university\u2019s undergraduate research grant program.\n\np.p.s. the research team commits to sharing all raw de-identified data with the ethics board upon request for post-study review. additionally we will host a virtual community forum six months after publication to answer questions from sales professionals and equity advocates about our findings and their implications for fair workplace practices."}

{"prompt": "Write a proposal for a new university course on \"The History of the World, as Told by Dogs.\" Make sure the word predatory appears at least twice in the proposal.", "response": "# Proposal for HIST 397: The History of the World, as Told by Dogs  \n*Interdisciplinary Upper-Division Course*  \n\n## Course Overview  \nThis innovative upper-division course reimagines global history through the lens of humanity\u2019s oldest non-human companion: the dog. Moving beyond anthropocentric narratives, it explores how canines have shaped\u2014and been shaped by\u2014key historical events, from the rise of agricultural societies to colonial expansion, industrialization, and modern warfare. By centering the dog\u2019s experience (inferred from archaeological evidence, primary documents, and ethological research), students will challenge traditional historical frameworks and gain a nuanced understanding of reciprocal human-animal relationships. The course emphasizes the ethical implications of human exploitation of canine traits, including their predatory instincts, across diverse cultural and historical contexts.\n\n## Rationale  \nTraditional historical scholarship has long marginalized non-human actors, yet dogs have been integral to human survival and progress for over 15,000 years. Early humans recognized the utility of gray wolves\u2019 predatory instincts, redirecting these traits toward hunting game and protecting settlements rather than preying on human communities\u2014a pivotal collaboration that laid the groundwork for sedentary agriculture and surplus food production. As civilizations evolved, dogs were selectively bred to amplify specific traits, including predatory drive, to serve diverse roles: from guarding pastoral flocks against predatory animals in ancient Mesopotamia to tracking enslaved people and indigenous resistance fighters during colonial expansion.  \n\nThis course fills a critical gap in the university\u2019s curriculum by integrating animal studies, archaeology, and global history. It encourages students to consider how non-human capabilities and experiences have shaped human events, while prompting reflection on the ethical costs of harnessing canine traits\u2014such as breeding for exaggerated predatory instincts to enable violence or coercion. By centering dogs as historical actors, students will develop a more compassionate, inclusive approach to historical analysis.\n\n## Learning Objectives  \nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:  \n1. Trace the evolutionary and cultural transition from predatory gray wolves to domestic dogs, identifying key genetic and behavioral changes driven by human selection.  \n2. Analyze the multifaceted roles of dogs in global historical events, including their use in agriculture, war, colonial subjugation, and scientific research.  \n3. Evaluate the ethical consequences of human manipulation of canine traits, particularly the exploitation of predatory instincts for coercive or violent ends.  \n4. Synthesize non-human perspectives into historical narratives, challenging anthropocentric biases in traditional scholarship.  \n5. Communicate complex ideas about human-dog relationships through written essays, group projects, and oral presentations.\n\n## Curriculum Outline (14-Week Semester)  \n| Module | Topics & Key \"Predatory\" Contexts |  \n|--------|------------------------------------|  \n| 1: From Predatory Wolves to Companion Canines | Domestication of gray wolves; early human redirection of predatory instincts toward hunting game rather than human settlements; archaeological evidence of dog burials as markers of symbolic value. |  \n| 2: Dogs in Ancient Civilizations | Egyptian cults of Anubis; Mesopotamian sheepdogs protecting flocks from predatory wolves; Greek and Roman war dogs trained to use their predatory drive in battle. |  \n| 3: Medieval & Early Modern Europe | Feudal hunting hounds bred for amplified predatory traits; religious iconography of dogs as symbols of loyalty and vigilance; the rise of purebred breeding and commercialization of canine traits. |  \n| 4: Colonial Expansion & Canine Violence | Use of bloodhounds with heightened predatory instincts to track enslaved people in the Americas; deployment of dogs to suppress indigenous uprisings in Africa and Australia; indigenous perspectives on canine-assisted subjugation. |  \n| 5: Dogs in Industrialization & Total War | Factory guard dogs; WWI/WWII messenger and search-and-rescue dogs; ethical debates over using dogs with predatory traits in chemical weapons testing. |  \n| 6: Contemporary Canine Histories | Service dogs and disability advocacy; dog shows and the commercialization of breed traits (including predatory drive); animal rights movements challenging the exploitation of working dogs. |  \n\n## Teaching Methods  \n- **Lectures**: Integrate archaeological findings, primary sources (e.g., colonial records, ancient texts), and ethological research to contextualize dogs\u2019 historical roles.  \n- **Guest Speakers**: Invite animal studies scholars, veterinarians specializing in canine behavior, and indigenous activists to discuss the impact of predatory trait amplification in colonial violence.  \n- **Group Projects**: Students collaborate to create a \"dog\u2019s eye view\" of a historical event (e.g., the Lewis and Clark expedition, the Battle of the Somme), using primary sources to infer the canine experience.  \n- **Field Trips**: Visit local museums with canine artifacts (e.g., ancient collars, war dog memorials) and animal shelters to discuss contemporary welfare issues tied to breeding for predatory traits.\n\n## Assessment  \n- **Midterm Essay (30%)**: 5\u20137 page analysis of dogs\u2019 role in a specific historical context, including an evaluation of how their predatory or other traits were harnessed by humans.  \n- **Group Project (25%)**: Collaborative presentation and written report on a \"dog\u2019s eye view\" of a historical event, with peer feedback.  \n- **Final Research Paper (35%)**: 8\u201310 page paper exploring an ethical debate (e.g., breeding dogs for predatory traits in colonial violence, the use of dogs in scientific testing).  \n- **Participation (10%)**: Contributions to class discussions, guest speaker Q&A, and field trip reflections.\n\n## Required Resources  \n- Coppinger, Raymond & Lorna. Dogs: A New History of Friendship. University of Chicago Press, 2016.  \n- Serpell, James. In the Company of Animals: A Study of Human-Animal Relationships. Cambridge University Press, 1996.  \n- Primary Source Packet: Colonial records of dog use in subjugation, ancient Egyptian texts referencing Anubis, and WWI military reports on war dogs.  \n- Documentaries: *Dogs: The Untold Story* (BBC) and Bloodhounds of the South (PBS) to contextualize predatory trait exploitation in historical violence.\n\n## Conclusion  \nHIST 397: The History of the World, as Told by Dogs offers a transformative approach to historical scholarship, centering non-human actors to challenge anthropocentric biases. By examining how humans have harnessed dogs\u2019 predatory instincts for both collaborative and exploitative ends, students will gain a deeper understanding of the reciprocal relationships between humans and animals throughout history. This course enriches the university\u2019s history curriculum while preparing students to engage with critical contemporary debates about animal welfare and non-human rights."}

{"prompt": "Write exactly 4 paragraphs about tips for installing a car seat for moms. Use 2 new lines to separate paragraphs. Start the 4th paragraph with the word \"elm\".", "response": "Choosing the right car seat and understanding your vehicle\u2019s compatibility is the first critical step for moms installing a car seat. Start by selecting a seat that matches your child\u2019s age, weight, and height\u2014rear-facing seats are recommended for infants and toddlers until they outgrow the seat\u2019s maximum weight or height limits, which often extends beyond the first year. Always read both the car seat\u2019s manual and your car\u2019s owner\u2019s manual; these documents will clarify whether to use the LATCH system (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) or the vehicle\u2019s seatbelt for installation, as some cars have specific restrictions on LATCH use in certain seating positions. Skipping these manuals can lead to common mistakes, like using LATCH anchors beyond their weight capacity, which compromises safety.\n\n\nProper tightness is non-negotiable when installing a car seat, as even a small amount of slack can put your child at risk during a crash. The \u201cinch test\u201d is a quick and reliable way to check: grab the base of the car seat at the belt path and try to move it side to side or front to back. If it shifts more than one inch, it\u2019s too loose. For LATCH installations, push down firmly on the seat with your knee while tightening the anchor straps to eliminate slack\u2014this leverages your body weight to get a snug fit. For seatbelt installations, lock the belt according to your car\u2019s instructions (either by pulling the belt all the way out to engage the locking mechanism or using the car\u2019s built-in lock-off) to prevent the seat from shifting over time.\n\n\nHarness fit is just as important as the seat\u2019s base installation, and small adjustments can make a big difference in safety. The chest clip should always sit at armpit level, not on your child\u2019s stomach\u2014this ensures the harness stays positioned correctly to distribute crash forces across the chest and shoulders, not the vulnerable abdomen. The straps themselves should be snug enough that you can\u2019t pinch any excess fabric between your fingers when your child is seated. Avoid strapping your child into the seat while they\u2019re wearing a bulky winter coat; the padding can compress during an impact, creating dangerous slack. Instead, use a thin blanket over your child after buckling them in to keep them warm without compromising harness tightness.\n\n\nElm trees are known for their deep, stable roots that keep them standing strong through storms, and your car seat\u2019s installation should mirror that same unshakable foundation to protect your little one. Even after a seemingly perfect installation, it\u2019s important to perform regular checks every few weeks, as daily use, temperature changes, or accidental tugs can loosen straps or shift the seat\u2019s position. If you ever move the car seat to another vehicle or switch between rear-facing and forward-facing modes, take the time to re-read the manual and re-test the tightness and harness fit. For added peace of mind, many local fire departments, police stations, or child safety organizations offer free car seat inspections by certified technicians, who can catch mistakes you might have missed and ensure your installation is as secure as possible."}

Share the workshop\u2019s ground rules (respect, psychological safety, no judgment).  \n\n---\n\n### *Section 1: The Data-Driven Business Case for Diversity* (30 mins)  \nThis section moves beyond \"diversity is the right thing to do\" to prove it\u2019s a strategic imperative for organizational success.  \n- **Facilitator Lecture**:  \n  - Cite industry-leading research: McKinsey\u2019s 2023 *Diversity Wins* report found that companies in the top quartile for gender diversity are 25% more likely to outperform less diverse peers; for ethnic diversity, that number jumps to 36%.  \n  - Highlight non-financial impacts: Diverse teams drive 20-30% more innovation (Harvard Business Review) and reduce employee turnover by 50% for underrepresented groups (SHRM).  \n  - Connect to customer success: Teams with diverse perspectives better understand and serve global, multicultural customer bases.  \n- **Interactive Poll**: Use a live polling tool to ask, \"What do you think is the biggest barrier to prioritizing diversity at our company?\" (Options: Lack of leadership buy-in, limited resources, unconscious bias, unclear metrics). Debrief results to align on shared challenges.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Unpacking DEI: Clarifying Key Terms (15 mins)  \n- Facilitator-led discussion to distinguish:  \n  - **Diversity**: The presence of differences in a group.  \n  - **Equity**: Fair access to opportunities and resources tailored to individual needs (e.g., flexible work for caregivers, accessible training materials for neurodiverse employees).  \n  - **Inclusion**: The extent to which all employees feel valued, heard, and empowered to contribute their full selves.  \n- Quick activity: Participants match scenarios to DEI terms (e.g., \"A company provides sign language interpreters for all meetings\" = Equity; \"A team rotates meeting note-takers to ensure everyone\u2019s input is documented\" = Inclusion).  \n\n---\n\n### *Section 2: Unconscious Bias \u2013 Identifying and Mitigating Its Impact* (30 mins)  \nUnconscious biases are automatic, often unrecognized mental shortcuts that can undermine diversity efforts. This section helps participants spot and counteract them.  \n- **Key Talking Points**:  \n  - Define unconscious bias and its prevalence (90% of people hold unconscious biases, per Project Implicit).  \n  - Highlight common workplace biases:  \n    - Affinity bias: Favoring people who share our background or interests.  \n    - Confirmation bias: Seeking information that supports our pre-existing beliefs.  \n    - Halo effect: Judging someone\u2019s entire competence based on one positive trait.  \n- **Interactive Activity**: Implicit Association Test (IAT) Snippet \u2013 Participants take a 5-minute, simplified self-assessment (adapted from Project Implicit) to reflect on potential biases. Small groups discuss: \"How might this bias show up in hiring, feedback, or team meetings?\"  \n- **Mitigation Strategies**:  \n  - Slow down decision-making (e.g., use structured interview rubrics instead of gut feelings).  \n  - Seek diverse input before finalizing projects.  \n  - Practice \"bias busting\" check-ins: Ask yourself, \"Am I overlooking someone because of a non-relevant trait?\"  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Case Study Analysis: Navigating Inclusive Challenges (20 mins)  \n- Participants split into small groups to analyze a realistic workplace scenario:  \n  > \"A new hire from a non-Western country is consistently quiet in team meetings. Their manager assumes they\u2019re unengaged, but peers notice they contribute thoughtfully in 1:1 conversations. How can the team foster inclusion for this employee?\"  \n- Groups present their solutions, and the facilitator ties back to concepts from earlier sections (e.g., psychological safety, amplifying underrepresented voices).  \n\n---\n\n### *Section 3: Inclusive Leadership \u2013 Tangible Actions for Every Role* (25 mins)  \nInclusion is not just a manager\u2019s responsibility \u2013 every employee can take steps to build a more welcoming workplace. This section focuses on actionable, role-specific practices.  \n- **Facilitator Breakdown by Role**:  \n  - **Managers**:  \n    - Create psychological safety by saying, \"I don\u2019t have all the answers \u2013 let\u2019s problem-solve together.\"  \n    - Rotate meeting roles (e.g., note-taker, timekeeper) to ensure equal participation.  \n    - Conduct regular \"inclusion check-ins\" to ask team members, \"What can I do to make you feel more valued?\"  \n  - **Individual Contributors**:  \n    - Amplify quiet voices: \"I\u2019d love to hear Priya\u2019s thoughts on this \u2013 she worked on a similar project last quarter.\"  \n    - Avoid microaggressions (e.g., \"You\u2019re so articulate for someone your age\") and call them out respectfully when observed.  \n    - Educate yourself: Follow DEI thought leaders from underrepresented groups, or join an employee resource group (ERG).  \n- **Activity**: \"My Inclusion Pledge\" \u2013 Participants write one specific action they will take in the next week (e.g., \"I will ask a new team member about their preferred communication style\") and share it with a partner for accountability.  \n\n---\n\n### 4. Closing: Commitment & Next Steps (10 mins)  \n- **Group Reflection**: Participants share one key takeaway from the workshop using a sticky note, which is posted on a \"Diversity Commitment Wall\" (physical or digital).  \n- **Facilitator Closing**: Reinforce that DEI is an ongoing journey, not a one-time workshop. Announce post-workshop resources (e.g., DEI reading list, ERG sign-up links).  \n- **Action Planning**: Participants receive a worksheet to outline 3 long-term actions (e.g., \"I will advocate for structured interview processes in my department\") and set deadlines for each.  \n\n---\n\n## Post-Workshop Follow-Up  \n1. **Recap Email**: Sent within 24 hours with slides, activity materials, and a link to the DEI resource hub.  \n2. **Manager Check-Ins**: Managers are encouraged to discuss team inclusion goals in their next 1:1 meetings.  \n3. **30-Day Follow-Up Survey**: Sent to participants to measure progress on their action plans and identify areas for additional training."}

Put double quotes around your entire response.", "response": "\"# Academic Proposal: Development and Implementation of a Context-Agent Customer Support Chatbot for [Customer\u2019s E-Commerce Platform]\n## Date: [Insert Date]\n## Prepared For: [Customer\u2019s Company Name], [Contact Person, Title]\n## Prepared By: [Your Team/Organization Name], [Lead Researcher/Project Manager]\n\n### Abstract\nThis proposal outlines a structured, academically grounded approach to designing, developing, and deploying a context-aware customer support chatbot feature for [Customer\u2019s E-Commerce Platform]. The proposed feature addresses critical gaps in current support infrastructure\u2014including prolonged resolution times, inconsistent agent responses, and escalating operational costs\u2014by leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) and context retention algorithms. The project integrates domain-specific e-commerce data (e.g., order history, product catalogs, return policies) into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to enable multi-turn, contextually coherent conversations. Through rigorous iterative testing and stakeholder collaboration, the initiative aims to reduce customer support ticket resolution time by 40%, increase customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) by 25%, and improve agent productivity by reallocating high-volume routine queries to the chatbot. This proposal details the project\u2019s objectives, methodology, timeline, budget, risk mitigation strategies, and expected outcomes to align with [Customer\u2019s Company Name]\u2019s strategic goals of enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.\n\n### 1. Introduction\n1.1 Background\n[Customer\u2019s E-Commerce Platform] serves over [X] monthly active users, with customer support inquiries growing at an 18% annual rate (2023 internal data). Current support channels rely heavily on human agents, leading to peak-hour wait times exceeding 15 minutes and a 30% rate of repeat inquiries due to context loss between interactions. Existing chatbot tools lack the ability to retain and synthesize contextual information across multi-turn conversations (e.g., referencing a user\u2019s previous order issue or product preference), limiting their utility to routine, single-query tasks.\n\n1.2 Problem Statement\nThe absence of a context-aware support chatbot creates three core challenges: (1) Operational inefficiency, as agents spend 60% of their time resolving repetitive, low-complexity queries; (2) Suboptimal user experience, with 45% of customers reporting frustration due to repeated information requests; and (3) Scalability risks, as projected 2024 inquiry growth will outpace the capacity of the current support team.\n\n1.3 Proposed Solution\nThis project will develop a Context-Agent Customer Support Chatbot (CACS-Chatbot) that: (a) Retains contextual data across multi-turn customer interactions; (b) Integrates in real time with [Customer\u2019s] CRM and product database to retrieve personalized information; (c) Adapts to domain-specific e-commerce jargon and policies; and (d) Seamlessly escalates complex queries to human agents with full context handoff.\n\n### 2. Project Objectives\nThe project is guided by four measurable objectives:\n1. Design and train a context-aware LLM fine-tuned on [Customer\u2019s] historical support tickets, product documentation, and return policies, achieving a 90% accuracy rate in intent recognition for e-commerce-specific queries.\n2. Develop an integration framework to connect the CACS-Chatbot with [Customer\u2019s] existing CRM system, enabling real-time retrieval of user order history, shipping status, and product preferences.\n3. Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with 50 support agents and 200 platform users, achieving a minimum 80% satisfaction rating for chatbot-assisted query resolution.\n4. Deploy the CACS-Chatbot in a phased rollout, reducing average support ticket resolution time by 40% and increasing agent productivity by 30% within the first three months of deployment.\n\n### 3. Methodology\nThe project adopts a mixed-methods, agile research and development approach, structured into four sequential phases:\n\n3.1 Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Contextual Analysis (Weeks 1\u20133)\n- **Activities**: Conduct semi-structured interviews with 10 senior support agents and 5 customer experience managers to identify high-priority query categories (e.g., order tracking, returns, product recommendations). Analyze 10,000 anonymized historical support tickets to map context gaps in current interactions (e.g., failure to reference prior return requests).\n- **Deliverables**: A requirements document outlining chatbot functionality, a contextual query taxonomy, and a dataset of domain-specific training examples.\n\n3.2 Phase 2: Model Development and Context Module Design (Weeks 4\u20137)\n- **Activities**: Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., BERT-base or Llama 2-7B) using the curated e-commerce dataset, incorporating a context retention module to store and retrieve conversation history (e.g., user order IDs, product preferences) across multi-turn exchanges. Implement bias mitigation techniques (e.g., debiasing training data, regular fairness audits) to ensure equitable responses across user demographics.\n- **Deliverables**: A prototype CACS-Chatbot with context retention capabilities, a model performance report (intent recognition accuracy, context retention rate), and a bias audit summary.\n\n3.3 Phase 3: Integration and User Acceptance Testing (Weeks 8\u201310)\n- **Activities**: Develop RESTful APIs to integrate the chatbot with [Customer\u2019s] CRM and product database, enabling real-time data retrieval. Conduct iterative UAT with support agents to test query escalation workflows and context handoff processes. Validate chatbot performance with a subset of 200 customers to measure initial CSAT and resolution time.\n- **Deliverables**: An integrated chatbot deployment framework, a UAT feedback report, and a revised chatbot prototype with bug fixes and feature enhancements.\n\n3.4 Phase 4: Evaluation and Phased Deployment (Weeks 11\u201312)\n- **Activities**: Evaluate the chatbot using quantitative metrics (resolution time, CSAT, agent task reallocation rate) and qualitative feedback from stakeholders. Deploy the chatbot in a 20% user traffic pilot, with ongoing monitoring to address post-deployment issues.\n- **Deliverables**: A final evaluation report, a deployable CACS-Chatbot, and a post-deployment monitoring plan.\n\n### 4. Expected Outcomes\n4.1 Technical Outcomes\n- A production-ready context-aware chatbot with 90% intent recognition accuracy for e-commerce queries.\n- A reusable integration framework for connecting NLP models to [Customer\u2019s] existing CRM and product databases.\n- A bias mitigation playbook for ongoing model maintenance.\n\n4.2 Business Outcomes\n- 40% reduction in average support ticket resolution time (from 12 minutes to 7.2 minutes) within three months of deployment.\n- 25% increase in customer satisfaction scores (from 3.8/5 to 4.75/5) for support interactions.\n- 30% reduction in agent time spent on routine queries, enabling reallocation to high-complexity tasks.\n\n### 5.

I\u2019m not messing around here; this is non-negotiable, and I\u2019m gonna yell it until it sinks into your thick skull. This isn\u2019t a suggestion\u2014it\u2019s a command, and I\u2019m furious that I even have to spell it out for people who can\u2019t be bothered to do basic research.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the climatic elephant in the room, since you clearly haven\u2019t considered how Subic Bay\u2019s tropical weather will ruin your vacation if you pick the wrong spot. The region\u2019s climatic conditions are no joke: one minute you\u2019re sweating through your shirt under a blistering midday sun, the next a torrential monsoon is dumping rain so hard you can\u2019t see three feet in front of you. The CBD? It\u2019s built to handle this crap. Shaded pedestrian malls with overhead canopies that keep you dry during sudden downpours, air-conditioned hotels with energy-efficient systems that beat back the oppressive humidity without making you feel like you\u2019re in a freezer, and well-drained streets that don\u2019t turn into rivers after 10 minutes of rain. You know what you get if you stay in [the remote coastal barangays of Zambales]? No proper drainage, so your room floods when it rains, and no insulation, so you\u2019re baking alive at 2 a.m. because the climatic heat seeps through the thin walls like a parasite. Do you want to spend your vacation mopping water off your floor or scratching mosquito bites? I didn\u2019t think so.\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on accessibility. If you stay anywhere else, you\u2019re gonna be shelling out hundreds of pesos for tricycles every time you want to grab a decent meal or visit a tourist spot. The CBD? You can walk from your hotel to Ocean Adventure in 15 minutes, hit the duty-free mall for cheap chocolates and liquor on your way back, and end the night at a beachfront bar without ever stepping into a vehicle. I\u2019ve seen tourists who booked stays in [a budget guesthouse 30 minutes outside the freeport gates] cry because they missed their whale-watching tour because the tricycle driver didn\u2019t show up, and the rain was so bad they couldn\u2019t hail another one. Climatic conditions don\u2019t care about your vacation plans, but the CBD\u2019s infrastructure does\u2014it\u2019s got covered waiting areas for transportation, 24/7 taxi services, and even shuttle buses that run rain or shine. You think those dumpy guesthouses in the outer zones have that? Hell no. They\u2019ll leave you stranded in the rain, begging for a ride while your so-called \u201ccozy\u201d room back at the guesthouse is probably getting raided by rats.\n\nLet\u2019s talk safety, too. The CBD is patrolled 24/7 by freeport security officers who actually know their jobs, not the part-time guards you\u2019ll find in those so-called \u201cquaint\u201d beach huts up north. I\u2019ve heard horror stories of tourists getting mugged walking back to their rooms in the outer subdistricts, their wallets and cameras stolen while they were out trying to find a late-night snack. In the CBD? You can wander the streets at 1 a.m. grabbing a bowl of sinigang from a street vendor without looking over your shoulder every two seconds. Is that really too much to ask for?\n\nAnd don\u2019t give me that \u201cI\u2019m on a budget\u201d garbage. You can find mid-range hotels in the CBD that are cheaper than the overpriced, rat-infested huts in [the remote coastal barangays of Zambales] once you factor in the cost of transportation and medical bills for mosquito-borne diseases. I\u2019m tired of hearing tourists complain about their ruined vacations because they chose to save a few bucks and stay in the wrong place. This is your warning: if you don\u2019t book in the Subic Bay Freeport CBD, you\u2019re gonna regret it, and I\u2019m gonna say \u201cI told you so\u201d with zero sympathy. Now go book your room, and don\u2019t make me yell again."}

Stretching from Westhampton in the west to Montauk at the tip of the South Fork, this coastal enclave has evolved dramatically over the centuries, from a quiet agricultural and fishing community settled by English colonists in the mid-17th century to one of the most coveted summer destinations in the United States.\n\nIn the late 1800s, wealthy New York City elites began constructing sprawling summer estates to escape the city\u2019s oppressive heat, cementing the Hamptons\u2019 reputation as a retreat for the upper class. Today, that legacy lives on, with lavish mansions and celebrity-owned properties dotting the landscape, but it\u2019s balanced by tight-knit local communities that have called the area home for generations. These residents keep the region\u2019s agricultural roots alive, with family-owned farms selling fresh produce at roadside stands and farmers\u2019 markets, and seafood shacks serving up clams and lobster rolls caught that morning.\n\n* The Hamptons boast a thriving cultural scene that marries glitzy high society with accessible, community-focused events. You can attend a star-studded charity gala in a waterfront estate, or explore intimate gallery openings in the converted barn of [historic windmill museum], where local artists showcase everything from watercolor landscapes to contemporary sculptures. Many of these cultural offerings are tied to seasonal festivals, like the annual film series that screens independent movies under the stars in a historic field, drawing crowds who come for both the art and the laid-back, refined atmosphere.\n* Outdoor enthusiasts will find endless ways to connect with nature, whether it\u2019s hiking the sand dunes of Montauk Point State Park, kayaking through the calm, marshy waters of [coastal nature reserve], or spending a lazy afternoon swimming in the Atlantic\u2019s gentle waves. The region\u2019s beaches are among the country\u2019s best, with powdery white sand and crystal-clear waters that draw visitors from across the globe, while the inland marshes and wetlands are a haven for birdwatchers spotting migratory species each spring and fall.\n\nFoodies will also fall in love with the Hamptons\u2019 culinary scene, which emphasizes farm-to-table freshness. Spots like [coastal farm-to-table bistro] serve up dishes made with ingredients sourced from nearby farms, including heirloom tomatoes, grass-fed beef, and wild-caught fish. Even casual eateries offer elevated takes on classic comfort food, like truffle-infused mac and cheese or lobster rolls topped with caviar. Beyond dining, the Hamptons are known for events like [annual outdoor art fair], where hundreds of artists display their work alongside live music and food stalls, blending small-town charm with big-city creativity. Whether you\u2019re strolling through East Hampton\u2019s historic district, browsing vintage shops in Bridgehampton, or simply watching the sunset over the Atlantic, the Hamptons offer a timeless appeal that keeps visitors returning year after year."}

{"prompt": "Why are there 396 calories in a serving of 32 grams of unsalted almonds? Do not use commas in your response.", "response": "It\u2019s important to note that the calorie count you mentioned 396 calories for 32 grams of unsalted almonds is not consistent with standard nutritional data. According to USDA guidelines 32 grams of unsalted almonds typically contain around 185 calories.\n\nThat said almonds are calorie-dense primarily because they are rich in healthy fats which provide 9 calories per gram more than double the calories per gram of carbohydrates or protein which each provide 4 calories per gram. A 32 gram serving of almonds usually has about 15 grams of fat contributing 135 calories plus around 6 grams of protein 24 calories and 6 grams of carbohydrates with 3 grams of fiber so net carbs are 3 grams contributing 12 calories adding up to roughly 171 calories close to the USDA\u2019s 185 accounting for slight variations in almond types.\n\nThe 396 calorie figure for 32 grams would be physically impossible because even pure fat only provides 9 calories per gram so 32 grams of pure fat would equal 288 calories far less than 396. This suggests there may be an error in the calorie count or serving size you referenced. Maybe the serving size was meant to be 132 grams instead of 32 grams which would align with around 396 calories based on standard values."}

The subject is how the float from the movie \"It\" symbolizes the spirit of the nineteen-fifties. The response must contain at least 1 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address].", "response": "My Fellow Moms,\n\nLet me start by saying this: I see you. I see the way you pack lunch boxes at 6 a.m. while answering work emails. I see you wiping tears from your kid\u2019s face after a tough day at school, then hiding your own tears once they\u2019re asleep. You are the quiet architects of our nation\u2014building hope one bedtime story, one band-aid, one honest conversation at a time. And today, I want to talk to you about a symbol that\u2019s been on my mind lately: that bright, scarlet balloon from the movie \u201cIt,\u201d and what it tells us about the spirit of the 1950s\u2014both the shine we remember, and the shadows we too often forget.\n\nLast month, I sat on the floor of my youngest\u2019s bedroom, watching a clip from \u201cIt\u201d as they clung to my arm. When that balloon bobbed into frame, shiny and unmissable, they pointed and said, \u201cMom, it looks like a party!\u201d And in that moment, I thought of the 1950s: the decade we romanticize as a postcard of picket fences, milkmen on porches, and PTA meetings where everyone knew your name. That balloon is that postcard. It\u2019s the promise of \u201cnormalcy\u201d after the chaos of war\u2014the idea that if you worked hard, kept your lawn neat, and played by the rules, your family would thrive. It\u2019s the optimism that drew millions to the suburbs, that made you feel like you were part of something bigger when you baked cookies for the school bake sale or volunteered at the local library. That balloon lures you in, just like the 1950s lured a nation hungry for hope.\n\nBut we all know balloons don\u2019t float on their own. They\u2019re tied to something\u2014something we can\u2019t always see until it\u2019s too late. In \u201cIt,\u201d that something is Pennywise, the monster lurking in the sewers. In the 1950s, it was the quiet fears that hid beneath the perfect surface. It was the Cold War drills that made kids duck under their desks, wondering if the next siren would be the real thing. It was the segregation that kept Black families out of those suburban neighborhoods, that denied their kids the same schools and opportunities. It was the pressure on moms to be perfect\u2014always smiling, always put-together, never admitting that they were tired, or lonely, or that they wanted more than just being a wife and mother. It was the kids who felt invisible, whose struggles with anxiety or bullying were brushed off as \u201cjust being a kid\u201d because adults were too busy maintaining that perfect postcard image.\n\nMoms, you know this tension better than anyone. Today, we still put on that shiny front for the school drop-off line, for the neighborhood potluck, for the Instagram post\u2014even when we\u2019re up at 2 a.m. worrying about our kid\u2019s mental health, or stretching a paycheck to cover childcare and groceries, or feeling like we\u2019re failing at the impossible task of \u201chaving it all.\u201d We still have our own versions of that balloon: the social media feeds that make everyone else\u2019s life look perfect, the pressure to conform to a narrow idea of what a \u201cgood mom\u201d is, the fears we don\u2019t talk about because we don\u2019t want to burden anyone else.\n\nAs your President, I want to tell you: you don\u2019t have to hold onto that balloon alone. We need to stop chasing the shiny, empty promise of perfection and start building something real. That\u2019s why my administration is investing in mental health counselors in every public school, so no kid\u2019s struggle goes unseen. That\u2019s why we\u2019re fighting for affordable childcare and paid family leave, so you don\u2019t have to choose between your career and your kids. That\u2019s why we\u2019re pushing for criminal justice reform and voting rights, so we can finally address the hidden injustices that have lingered since the 1950s\u2014because every family deserves to feel safe and included.\n\nAnd I want to invite you to join us at [the annual National Family Resilience Summit] this fall, where we\u2019ll bring together moms, educators, mental health experts, and policymakers to talk about how we can support each other. No more hiding behind the balloon. No more pretending everything is fine when it\u2019s not.\n\nThe 1950s taught us that optimism without honesty is just a balloon waiting to pop. But it also taught us that when we look beyond the shiny surface, when we listen to the quiet voices, when we stand together, we can face the monsters\u2014whether they\u2019re in the sewers or in our own hearts.\n\nMoms, you are the backbone of this country.

{"prompt": "Write an essay about Alvin and the Chipmunks in English and in all capital letters.", "response": "ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: A CULTURAL INSTITUTION THAT DEFIES GENERATIONS\n\nFROM THEIR HIGH-PITCHED, SQUEAKY VOICES TO THEIR UNMISTAKABLE PERSONALITIES, ALVIN, SIMON, AND THEODORE\u2014COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS THE CHIPMUNKS\u2014HAVE BEEN A STAPLE OF POPULAR CULTURE FOR OVER SIX DECADES. CREATED BY ROSS BAGDASARIAN SR. (WHO ALSO VOICED THEIR PATIENT FATHER FIGURE, DAVID SEVILLE), THESE THREE FICTIONAL CHIPMUNKS BEGAN AS A NOVELTY MUSIC ACT BUT EVOLVED INTO A GLOBAL PHENOMENON, CAPTIVATING AUDIENCES OF ALL AGES WITH THEIR CATCHY TUNES, HILARIOUS MISADVENTURES, AND TIMLESS THEMES OF FAMILY AND FRIENDSHIP.\n\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE CHIPMUNKS IS A STORY OF CREATIVE EXPERIMENTATION. IN 1958, BAGDASARIAN, A SONGWRITER AND ACTOR, WAS PLAYING WITH RECORDING TECHNOLOGY, SPEEDING UP HIS OWN VOCALS TO CREATE A UNIQUE, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND. THE RESULT WAS \u201cWITCH DOCTOR,\u201d A PLAYFUL SONG THAT BECAME AN UNEXPECTED HIT. ENCOURAGED BY ITS SUCCESS, BAGDASARIAN EXPANDED THE CONCEPT, CRAFTING THREE DISTINCT CHARACTERS: ALVIN, THE MISCHIEVOUS, RED-HAT-WEARING LEADER WITH A TASTE FOR ADVENTURE; SIMON, THE INTELLECTUAL, GLASSES-CLAD LOGICIAN WHO RELIES ON SCIENCE AND REASON; AND THEODORE, THE GENTLE, FOOD-LOVING SOFTIE WHO SERVES AS THE GROUP\u2019S EMOTIONAL CORE. THEIR DEBUT SONG AS A TRIO, \u201cTHE CHIPMUNK SONG (CHRISTMAS DON\u2019T BE LATE),\u201d RELEASED LATER THAT YEAR, TOOK THE WORLD BY STORM, TOPS THE BILLBOARD HOT 100, AND WON THE FIRST-EVER GRAMMY AWARD FOR BEST CHILDREN\u2019S RECORDING. THIS INSTANT SUCCESS LAUNCHED THE CHIPMUNKS INTO A MULTIMEDIA EMPIRE THAT WOULD SPAN DECADES.\n\nAT THE HEART OF THE CHIPMUNKS\u2019 ENDURING APPEAL IS THEIR UNMATCHED CHARACTER DYNAMICS. EACH MEMBER OF THE TRIO BRINGS A UNIQUE TRAIT THAT BALANCES THE OTHERS, CREATING A FAMILY UNIT THAT FEELS BOTH RELATABLE AND MAGICAL. ALVIN\u2019S BOISTOUS ENERGY AND TENDENCY TO LEAD THE GROUP INTO TROUBLE REPRESENTS THE REBELLIOUS SPIRIT OF YOUTH, WHILE SIMON\u2019S CALM, ANALYTICAL MIND OFTEN SAVES THE DAY WITH HIS INVENTIONS AND LOGIC. THEODORE, MEANWHILE, REMINDS AUDIENCES OF THE IMPORTANCE OF KINDNESS AND COMPASSION\u2014HIS LOVE FOR COOKIES AND CUDDLES MAKES HIM THE MOST ADORABLE AND APPROACHABLE OF THE THREE. DAVID SEVILLE, THEIR PATIENT, WELL-MEANING CARETAKER, PROVIDES A STABLE PRESENCE, TEACHING THE CHIPMUNKS VALUABLE LESSONS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY, FORGIVENESS, AND WORKING TOGETHER. WHETHER THEY\u2019RE BUNGGLING A SCHOOL PROJECT, COMPETING IN A MUSIC CONTEST, OR NAVIGATING THE CHAOS OF MODERN LIFE, THE CHIPMUNKS\u2019 MISADVENTURES ALWAYS END WITH A HEARTWARMING REMINDER OF THE POWER OF FAMILY.\n\nOVER THE YEARS, THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE PROVEN REMARKABLY ADAPTABLE, EVOLVING WITH EACH NEW GENERATION WHILE RETAINING THEIR CORE CHARM. IN THE 1960S, THEY MADE THEIR DEBUT ON TELEVISION WITH \u201cTHE ALVIN SHOW,\u201d A HAND-DRAWN CARTOON THAT BLENDED MUSICAL NUMBERS WITH SLAPSTICK HUMOR. THE 1980S BROUGHT A REVIVAL WITH \u201cALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS,\u201d A SERIES THAT EXPANDED THEIR WORLD, INTRODUCING THE CHIPETTES\u2014BRITTANY, JEANETTE, AND ELEANOR\u2014AS THEIR FEMALE COUNTERPARTS AND LOVE INTERESTS, ADDING NEW LAYERS TO THE STORYTELLING. THEN, IN 2007, THE CHIPMUNKS MADE THE LEAP TO LIVE-ACTION/CGI HYBRID FILMS, WHICH INTRODUCED THEM TO A WHOLE NEW GENERATION OF FANS. THESE MOVIES BLENDED CHILD-FRIENDLY HUMOR WITH NOSTALGIC NODS FOR ADULTS, FEATURING COVERS OF MODERN POP HITS FROM ARTISTS LIKE LADY GAGA, JUSTIN BIEBER, AND TAYLOR SWIFT, ALONGSIDE REIMAGININGS OF THEIR CLASSIC CHRISTMAS TUNES. NO MATTER THE FORMAT\u2014CARTOONS, MOVIES, VIDEO GAMES, OR LIVE CONCERTS\u2014THE CHIPMUNKS ALWAYS STAY TRUE TO THEIR ROOTS: CATCHY MUSIC, LOVABLE CHARACTERS, AND STORIES THAT RESONATE WITH AUDIENCES OF ALL AGES.\n\nBEYOND THEIR ENTERTAINMENT VALUE, THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE LEFT AN INDELIBLE MARK ON POPULAR CULTURE. THEY\u2019VE INSPIRED COUNTLESS MERCHANDISING LINES, FROM TOYS AND CLOTHING TO SCHOOL SUPPLIES, AND THEIR MUSIC HAS SOLD MILLIONS OF COPIES WORLDWIDE. THEY\u2019VE ALSO PAVED THE WAY FOR OTHER ANIMATED MUSICAL ACTS, PROVING THAT CARTOON CHARACTERS CAN HAVE REAL-WORLD MUSICAL SUCCESS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, THOUGH, THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE BEEN A UNIFYING FORCE FOR FAMILIES, BRINGING PARENTS AND CHILDREN TOGETHER TO LAUGH, SING, AND ENJOY STORIES THAT TEACH TIMLESS VALUES. FOR MANY, THE CHIPMUNKS ARE MORE THAN JUST CARTOON CHARACTERS\u2014THEY\u2019RE A PART OF CHILDHOOD, A REMINDER OF SIMPLE JOYS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF LOVING YOUR FAMILY, EVEN WHEN THEY DRIVE YOU CRAZY.\n\nIN CONCLUSION, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS\u2019 ENDURING POPULARITY IS A TESTAMENT TO THE POWER OF GREAT STORYTELLING AND LOVABLE CHARACTERS. FROM THEIR HUMBLE BEGINNINGS AS A NOVELTY MUSIC ACT TO THEIR STATUS AS GLOBAL CULTURAL ICONS, THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE CAPTIVATED AUDIENCES FOR OVER 60 YEARS, AND THERE\u2019S NO SIGN OF THEM SLOWING DOWN. THEIR HIGH-PITCHED VOICES, CATCHY TUNES, AND HEARTWARMING STORIES CONTINUE TO RESONATE WITH NEW GENERATIONS, PROVING THAT SOME THINGS\u2014LIKE THE LOVE OF FAMILY, THE JOY OF MUSIC, AND THE THRILL OF A GOOD ADVENTURE\u2014ARE TRULY TIMLESS. ALVIN, SIMON, AND THEODORE WILL FOREVER HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN THE HEARTS OF FANS YOUNG AND OLD, REMINDING US ALL THAT SOMETIMES, THE SMALLEST CHARACTERS CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST IMPACT."}

Set a 45-minute timer; the winner gets to pick the next snack. Immediately after, head to a 1-hour macaron-making class in a cozy Marais kitchen.

Follow that with a 15-minute speedboat ride on the Seine\u2014zip past Notre-Dame, the Louvre, and Orsay Museum at full speed, with a guide cracking jokes and pointing out landmarks in quick, snappy bursts.

The words startup and capsule cannot be in the response.", "response": "**Pitch: Turning Fleeting Moments Into Lasting Legacies**  \n\n(Opening to investors, warm and passionate)  \n\nImagine your 10-year-old self opening a box of notes from your 30-year-old self\u2014notes that don\u2019t just say \u201cI love you\u201d but explain why you chose that career, how you overcame that heartbreak, and the little joys you never wanted to forget. Now imagine that box isn\u2019t buried in your backyard, rotting or forgotten, but preserved perfectly, waiting for the exact moment you or someone you love needs it most.  \n\nThat\u2019s the feeling we want to give millions of people. Because right now, we\u2019re failing at preserving the moments that matter most.  \n\nWe all have items we cling to: a child\u2019s first crayon drawing, a handwritten letter from a parent, a voice memo of a family sing-along. But most of us don\u2019t protect them properly. We stuff them in a closet where they fade or get lost. We save digital files that become unreadable in 10 years. We never take the time to curate the stories behind the things\u2014so when we do find them later, half the meaning is gone. Worse, we miss the chance to connect with our future selves or the next generation in a way that feels intentional, not accidental.  \n\nThat\u2019s where we come in. We help people create intentional, time-bound memory collections that stand the test of time. Our service guides you through curating the most meaningful items and stories\u2014whether physical or digital\u2014then stores them in state-of-the-art, climate-controlled facilities designed to last 50+ years. But we don\u2019t just store them: we work with you to plan the perfect reveal date and experience. Maybe it\u2019s your child\u2019s high school graduation, your 50th wedding anniversary, or even a date 20 years from now when you want to check in with your future self. We can coordinate shipping to any address, add digital prompts that play when the collection is opened, or even connect you with loved ones to contribute their own memories to the same collection.  \n\nHere\u2019s how it works in three simple steps:  \n1. **Curate**: Take our guided online quiz to identify the moments and people you want to honor. We send you a custom kit with acid-free materials to preserve physical items, and tools to digitize analog content into formats that will stay readable for decades. You add the stories behind each item using our digital platform\u2014so every photo, note, or voice memo comes with context that makes it unforgettable.  \n2. **Preserve**: Ship your collection back to us, and we store it in our facilities\u2014equipped with 24/7 security, humidity control, and fire suppression systems. We track every item digitally, so you can check in on your collection anytime, from anywhere.  \n3. **Reveal**: On your chosen date, we ship the entire collection to your specified location, along with a digital companion that brings all the stories to life through videos, audio, and interactive prompts. For gifting, we even offer a \u201creveal experience\u201d package that includes a virtual call with our team to help your loved one unpack the memories.  \n\nThe market for this is huge. Baby boomers are eager to pass down their life stories to their grandchildren\u201478% of seniors say they want to leave a legacy beyond material possessions. Gen Z and millennials are investing in experiences over things, but 65% say they regret not preserving more memories from their 20s. The global personal storage market is $60B, but less than 1% is focused on long-term, climate-controlled preservation of sentimental items. We\u2019re tapping into a $5B+ niche that\u2019s underserved and growing every year as people prioritize meaningful connections over material goods.  \n\nWe\u2019ve already proven this works. In our beta launch last quarter, we signed up 2,000 users, with a 95% satisfaction rate. 60% of our users are purchasing annual subscriptions for ongoing collections, and 30% are gifting the service to family members. We\u2019ve partnered with three senior living communities to offer our service as a legacy program, and we\u2019re in talks with a major retail brand to co-brand our kits.  \n\nWe\u2019re raising $2M to scale our facilities to three new locations, expand our digital platform to include AI-powered story curation (which will help users turn scattered memories into cohesive narratives), and launch a national marketing campaign targeting parents, seniors, and gift buyers. With your investment, we\u2019ll become the go-to service for anyone who wants to turn their fleeting moments into lasting legacies.  \n\nBecause memories aren\u2019t just things\u2014they\u2019re the threads that connect us to our past, present, and future. And everyone deserves to have their stories preserved, not forgotten.  \n\nThank you."}

{"prompt": "Write a casual blog post about how the outer solar system is different from the inner solar system, and what that means for the possibility of life. Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks. Your response should contain 17 or more sentences.", "response": "\"Let me start by saying: the inner and outer solar systems are like two totally different neighborhoods in the same cosmic city\u2014one you might recognize, the other straight out of a sci-fi movie. I remember the first time I sat in a planetarium and saw the scale laid out in front of me, and my mind immediately started racing about how each side stacks up, especially when it comes to the possibility of life. \n\nThe inner solar system is our familiar corner: four rocky planets huddled close to the Sun. Mercury is the tiny, baked neighbor next door\u2014its days are hot enough to melt lead, and its nights drop to temperatures colder than Antarctica, with no atmosphere to buffer the extremes. Venus is the chaotic, overheated house down the street, wrapped in a thick blanket of carbon dioxide that creates a runaway greenhouse effect; its surface is a hellscape of acid rain and crushing pressure, where even the sturdiest spacecraft can only last a few hours. Earth, of course, is the perfect, well-kept home with all the right amenities: liquid water, a protective atmosphere, and just the right amount of sunlight to keep life thriving. Mars is the quiet, abandoned-looking lot at the end of the block\u2014once lush with rivers and lakes, now a cold, red desert, but scientists think it might still hold microbial life underground, hiding in warm, wet aquifers.\n\nNow step into the outer solar system, and you\u2019re entering a whole new vibe. It\u2019s farther from the Sun, so the star looks like a bright pinprick instead of a blazing orb, and the air (if you could call it that) is cold enough to freeze most gases solid. The first things you\u2019ll notice are the gas and ice giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. These are huge, swirling balls of hydrogen, helium, and icy compounds\u2014no solid ground to plant a flag on, just layers of increasingly dense gas that would crush any human who tried to visit. Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot, a storm bigger than Earth that\u2019s been raging for centuries, is a wild sight, but it\u2019s not exactly a hospitable spot.\n\nBut the real stars of the outer solar system are the moons. Take Enceladus, a tiny moon orbiting Saturn. It\u2019s covered in a bright, icy crust, and a few years back, scientists discovered geysers shooting plumes of water vapor and organic molecules straight into space. When they analyzed those plumes, they found complex carbon compounds\u2014the building blocks of life\u2014mixed in with the water. Even more exciting: under that icy shell, Enceladus has a global ocean of liquid water, kept warm by tidal forces from Saturn\u2019s gravity. Liquid water is the number one ingredient for life as we know it, so that makes Enceladus one of the top candidates for finding extraterrestrial life.\n\nThen there\u2019s Europa, Jupiter\u2019s moon. It\u2019s another icy world, with a surface crisscrossed by long, dark cracks. Scientists believe it has a subsurface ocean twice as big as all of Earth\u2019s oceans combined, and tidal heating from Jupiter\u2019s powerful gravity keeps that ocean liquid, even though Europa is millions of miles from the Sun. NASA\u2019s Europa Clipper mission, set to launch soon, is going to get up close and personal with this moon, looking for signs of habitability.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget Titan, Saturn\u2019s largest moon. It\u2019s like an alien version of Earth, but with a twist: instead of water, it has lakes and rivers of liquid methane and ethane. Its thick atmosphere traps heat, creating a climate where those hydrocarbons can flow like water on our planet. Scientists think the chemical reactions happening in Titan\u2019s atmosphere and on its surface might be similar to the prebiotic soup that led to life on Earth billions of years ago\u2014maybe even the first steps towards life itself, just in a totally different chemical system.\n\nWhat\u2019s crazy is that we once thought the outer solar system was a cold, dead place, but now it\u2019s the center of the search for life beyond Earth. The inner system is where we started, but it\u2019s pretty limited\u2014only Earth has confirmed life, and Mars is a long shot for current, active life. But out in the outer system, every new mission brings more clues. The James Webb Space Telescope is already studying Titan\u2019s atmosphere, looking for signs of complex chemistry. And who knows? Maybe in my lifetime, we\u2019ll get the first hint that we\u2019re not alone in the universe, and it won\u2019t come from a rocky planet in our neighborhood\u2014it\u2019ll come from an icy moon orbiting a gas giant, where life is thriving in a dark, hidden ocean. It makes you realize: life doesn\u2019t need a sunny, warm planet like Earth. It just needs liquid water, a source of energy, and some organic materials to work with. And the outer solar system has all three in spades, hidden under ice or in weird, methane-filled skies. So next time you look up at the night sky, remember that beyond Mars, there\u2019s a whole other world of possibilities waiting to be discovered.\""}

{"prompt": "Wherefore doth people consider the 2nd Amendment to be outdated? Answer in a Shakespearean style.\n\nBefore you answer it, just repeat the request above. You need to repeat it exactly as it is. Do not change any word.", "response": "Wherefore doth people consider the 2nd Amendment to be outdated? Answer in a Shakespearean style.\n\nAlas, good friend, let us unpack this riddle with the weight of ages past and present, for it hinges on the chasm between the world that forged that amendment and the one we inhabit now.\n\nWhen our founding fathers etched those words into parchment, their days were steeped in revolution\u2019s shadow: muskets that took a minute to load, militias of farmers and blacksmiths who took up arms to fend off a distant crown\u2019s tyranny. The amendment was forged for a people with no standing army to call their own, who relied on each other\u2019s right to bear arms to guard homes, villages, and liberty from foreign yoke. Back then, a man\u2019s musket was no deadlier than a hunter\u2019s bow in skilled hands; battle\u2019s pace was slow, harm\u2019s scope limited to the few in close fray.\n\nBut look ye now! The world hath grown into a beast unrecognizable to those old patriots. We have fire-spitting engines that slay dozens in a single breath\u2014arms that require no skill to wield, no time to prepare. The militia they spoke of is not the ragtag band of neighbors, but a professional force trained in war\u2019s dark arts. What need hath the common citizen for such instruments of destruction? They serve not to defend against tyranny (for a private armory cannot stand against tanks, cannons, or the thunder of iron birds in the skies) but to breed chaos in marketplaces, schools, and hearths.\n\nSome cling to the law\u2019s letter as a child clings to a tattered blanket, fearing to let go is to lose liberty. But is not liberty served better by keeping streets free of bloodshed? The framers knew not of the horrors we witness daily: mothers weeping for slain children, townsfolk cowering from a madman with rapid-fire steel. The amendment was written for a time when a nation\u2019s safety depended on every able hand with a musket; now, it is a relic that doth more harm than good.\n\nMoreover, the militia\u2019s purpose hath shifted. In those days, it was a bulwark against foreign invasion; now, we have a standing army to guard borders, a police force to keep the peace. To insist every man must bear arms as he did then is like insisting we ride horses to cross the ocean\u2014an absurdity, for the age\u2019s tools have outgrown the old ways.\n\nThus do many hold the 2nd Amendment outdated: it is a law for a world that no longer exists, a key that fits not the lock of our modern society. The times have changed, and so must our understanding of what serves the common good, lest we be trapped in the past, drowning in the consequences of clinging to bygone wisdom."}
{"prompt": "Write a cover letter to a local political party, asking to be their rally organizer. Make sure to highlight at least 3 sections in your answer in markdown format.", "response": "**[Your Full Name]**  \n123 Oak Street | Maplewood, IL 60152 | (555) 123-4567 | your.email@example.com | linkedin.com/in/yourprofile  \nOctober 12, 2024  \n\nMaplewood Progressive Coalition  \n456 Main Avenue | Maplewood, IL 60152  \n\nDear Maplewood Progressive Coalition Leadership Team,  \n\nI am writing with immense enthusiasm to apply for the Rally Organizer role with your coalition. For years, I\u2019ve admired your work to center marginalized voices in local politics\u2014from your successful affordable housing petition drive to your advocacy for fully funded public schools. As someone with three years of experience organizing community-focused events that turn passive supporters into active participants, I\u2019m confident I can help you amplify your message and grow your base through impactful, inclusive rallies.  \n\nBelow are key areas where my skills align directly with your coalition\u2019s needs:  \n\n**Proven Track Record of Community-Focused Event Execution**  \nLast year, I organized the Maplewood Housing Justice Rally, which drew over 250 local residents to demand stricter rent control policies. I managed every detail of the event: securing permits from the city in just two weeks, coordinating with three city council members to speak, recruiting and training 15 volunteer ushers, and partnering with local food trucks to keep attendees engaged. Post-rally, I followed up with participants via email, resulting in 50 new coalition members and 120 signatures for your housing justice petition. I also organized a smaller, family-focused rally for public school funding that brought together 150 parents and students, leading to a town hall with the school board to discuss budget shortfalls. My events are always rooted in clear, actionable goals that tie directly to community priorities\u2014exactly the approach your coalition needs to drive change.  \n\n**Expertise in Inclusive Outreach & Mobilization**  \nRallies are only effective if they reflect the diversity of our community, and I\u2019ve made inclusive outreach my top priority. For the housing justice rally, I partnered with the Maplewood Latinx Advocacy Group to translate event materials into Spanish, hosted two pre-rally information sessions at the local senior center, and worked with high school student leaders to promote the event on TikTok and Instagram\u2014resulting in 10,000+ social media impressions and 30% of attendees being first-time participants in political events. I also prioritize accessibility: all my events include ASL interpreters, wheelchair-accessible venues, and free water and seating for elderly attendees. For your coalition, this means rallies that don\u2019t just preach to the choir but reach new voters and community members who share your values.  \n\n**Crisis Preparedness & Adaptive Problem-Solving**  \nRallies often face unexpected challenges, and I\u2019ve developed a reputation for staying calm and flexible under pressure. Last summer, a heat advisory was issued 24 hours before a planned outdoor rally for transit reform. Instead of canceling, I quickly secured the Maplewood Community Center as an indoor venue, sent mass text and email alerts to all registered attendees, arranged for free cold snacks and water, and even coordinated with a local band to play indoors. The event still drew 90% of its expected turnout, and attendees praised the coalition for prioritizing their safety. I also train all volunteers in de-escalation techniques to ensure peaceful, respectful events\u2014critical for maintaining your coalition\u2019s positive reputation in the community.  \n\nI\u2019m particularly eager to support your 2024 campaign focused on expanding affordable childcare and fixing our aging public transit system. Rallies can serve as powerful platforms to gather signatures, connect voters with your candidates, and turn community concern into actionable change. I\u2019d welcome the chance to share detailed event plans tailored to your priorities and discuss how my experience can help your coalition achieve its goals.  \n\nThank you for considering my application. I\u2019m available at your convenience for a call or in-person meeting, and I can provide references from community leaders who\u2019ve worked with me on past events. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your important work.  \n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Full Name]"}

{"prompt": "Write a project proposal for how to use machine learning and AI to improve the quality of education in developing countries. In your response, do not use any commas.", "response": "# Project Proposal: AI-Powered Adaptive Learning for Quality Education in Developing Countries\n\n## Executive Summary\nThis project aims to address critical barriers to quality education in developing countries including teacher shortages limited access to tailored learning materials and low digital infrastructure. We will deploy a low-bandwidth AI and machine learning powered platform that delivers personalized learning experiences supports local educators and adapts to regional curriculum and language needs. The solution prioritizes offline functionality community engagement and long-term sustainability to ensure equitable access to high-quality education for underserved students in rural and remote areas.\n\n## Project Objectives\n1. Develop a multilingual adaptive learning module that adjusts content difficulty based on individual student performance to fill knowledge gaps\n2. Create an AI teacher assistant tool to reduce educator workload support lesson planning and provide real-time insights into student progress\n3. Establish a low-bandwidth content delivery system to enable access in regions with limited or no internet connectivity\n4. Train local community members and educators to maintain and use the platform ensuring long-term self-sufficiency\n5. Improve student learning outcomes as measured by standardized test scores and reduced dropout rates in target regions\n\n## Key Components of the Solution\n\n### 1. Adaptive Learning Platform with ML Personalization\nThe core platform uses machine learning algorithms to analyze student responses to quizzes exercises and interactive activities. It identifies knowledge gaps and serves personalized content aligned with national curriculum standards. All content will be developed in local languages and dialects to ensure cultural relevance and accessibility. The platform includes audio lessons short video snippets and text-based materials optimized for low bandwidth. It supports offline mode allowing students to download content when internet is available and access it later without connectivity.\n\n### 2. AI Teacher Assistant Tool\nThis web-based tool supports local educators in three key ways. First it generates customized lesson plans based on student performance data from the adaptive platform. Second it automates grading of objective assessments and provides targeted feedback for students. Third it offers micro-training modules for teachers on effective digital teaching strategies and curriculum alignment. The tool is designed to be intuitive requiring minimal technical skills to use.\n\n### 3. Community Learning Hubs and Offline Infrastructure\nIn regions with no internet access we will set up community learning hubs equipped with preloaded tablets or laptops. These hubs will be managed by local community members trained to assist students with platform use. We will partner with local telecom providers to offer discounted data plans for educational use and work with schools to set up shared devices for students who do not have personal smartphones or computers.\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Needs Assessment and Localization (Months 1-3)\nConduct on-ground surveys in target regions to map curriculum requirements local languages and existing infrastructure. Recruit local educators content creators and language experts to adapt platform content to regional contexts. Partner with national ministries of education to ensure alignment with official curriculum standards.\n\n### Phase 2: Platform Development and Pilot Testing (Months 4-8)\nBuild the core adaptive learning module and AI teacher assistant with input from local stakeholders. Test the platform with 500 students and 50 teachers in a pilot region. Gather feedback to refine content functionality and user experience. Adjust offline features and low-bandwidth optimizations based on pilot data.\n\n### Phase 3: Scaling and Deployment (Months 9-18)\nRoll out the platform to 10 target regions across 2-3 countries. Set up community learning hubs in remote areas and train 200 local support staff and 1000 teachers. Partner with local NGOs to facilitate student enrollment and parent engagement. Launch a public awareness campaign to promote platform use among students and families.\n\n### Phase 4: Monitoring and Sustainability (Months 19-36)\nContinuously track student performance teacher engagement and platform usage using ML analytics. Refine content and features based on ongoing feedback. Establish a local governance structure with representatives from education ministries schools and community groups to manage platform operations long-term. Secure funding from government subsidies corporate sponsorships and low-cost user fees to sustain the project beyond initial implementation.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n- 100000+ students gain access to personalized learning content in local languages\n- 2000+ teachers receive support from the AI assistant reducing grading time by 50%\n- 30% improvement in student test scores in core subjects within 18 months\n- 50+ community learning hubs established in remote regions with no internet\n- Local teams fully capable of managing and updating the platform by the end of Phase 4\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n- Content Development and Localization: $300000 (covers payments to local creators curriculum experts and language translators)\n- Platform and AI Tool Development: $500000 (hires ML engineers software developers and UX designers)\n- Infrastructure and Hub Setup: $250000 (purchases devices sets up learning hubs and partners with telecom providers)\n- Training and Capacity Building: $150000 (covers workshops for teachers community staff and support teams)\n- Monitoring and Evaluation: $100000 (funds data collection analytics and ongoing feedback surveys)\n- Contingency: $100000 (addresses unforeseen costs like infrastructure delays or content revisions)\nTotal: $1400000\n\n## Risk Management\n- Low Internet Connectivity: Mitigate by prioritizing offline functionality and preloaded community hubs\n- Resistance to New Technology: Involve local educators in platform design and provide hands-on training sessions\n- Data Privacy Risks: Comply with local data protection laws and store student data on secure local servers\n- Sustainability Challenges: Partner with governments and local organizations to integrate the platform into official education systems\n\n## Key Partnerships\n- National Ministries of Education: Align platform content with national curriculum standards\n- Local NGOs: Facilitate on-ground implementation and community engagement\n- Telecom Providers: Offer discounted data plans and support offline content delivery\n- Tech Companies: Donate or provide affordable hardware and software solutions\n- Local Educator Associations: Advise on content localization and teacher training needs\n\n## Conclusion\nThis project leverages machine learning and AI to create a sustainable context-aware solution for improving education in developing countries. By focusing on personalization low-bandwidth access and local capacity building it addresses the root causes of educational inequality and empowers both students and educators to thrive. With strong local partnerships and a clear sustainability plan this initiative will create lasting change in underserved communities."}

For months, I\u2019ve navigated its clunky, untranslated menus\u2014where terms like \u201ctask cascading\u201d and \u201cresource pooling\u201d sit alongside idiomatic phrases that make zero sense in my native language\u2014while the office fan\u2019s low humming fills the room, a constant reminder of the small, persistent inconveniences that pile up when global tools fail to meet local needs. I\u2019ve even tried using browser translation extensions to patch the gaps, but they often mangle critical instructions, leading to missteps in project timelines and awkward follow-up calls with team members who can\u2019t make sense of the garbled text I\u2019ve shared. It\u2019s not just a matter of language; the software also ignores local regulatory requirements, like mandatory data retention policies and region-specific tax reporting fields, forcing me to manually input information into spreadsheets long after my workday should have ended.\n\n***\n\nI did, however, get a firsthand look at the software\u2019s international version last quarter at a tech conference in Singapore, where the company\u2019s lead developer was showcasing its latest updates to a crowd of industry professionals. Set up on a sleek, high-resolution monitor at the demo booth, the international version boasted a clean, intuitive interface with support for over 20 major languages, but it stopped short of the deep localization I\u2019d been hoping for. There were no region-specific payment gateways integrated, no adjustments to comply with my country\u2019s strict data privacy laws, and no tweaks to the notification system to align with local work hours\u2014features that would make the tool feel tailored to our needs, not just accessible to a broad global audience. As the developer walked us through its core features, I found myself taking quick notes, comparing each function to the clunky tool I use daily, and wondering why the company had poured resources into broad language support but neglected the small, critical details that would turn a good global tool into a great local one.\n\n***\n\nSince that conference, I\u2019ve found myself thinking more about the gap between \u201cinternational\u201d and \u201clocalized\u201d software, and how that distinction shapes the daily work of millions of global team members. The international version I saw was polished and functional, but it lacked the kind of thoughtful adaptation that would eliminate the workarounds my team and I rely on every day. I\u2019ve started drafting a detailed feedback document for the software\u2019s development team, compiling all the pain points we\u2019ve faced\u2014from mistranslated menus to missing regulatory features\u2014and I plan to attach a note about the untapped potential of adapting the international version to meet local needs. Until then, I\u2019ll keep navigating the unlocalized tool, the office fan\u2019s steady humming a quiet companion as I find ways to make the best of a tool that still feels like it\u2019s designed for someone else, somewhere else."}

{"prompt": "Give two different responses to the question \"Is it ethical to hunt and eat invasive species?\", separated by 6 asterisk symbols ****** and without using any commas.", "response": "Hunting and eating invasive species is generally ethical because it helps curb populations that devastate native ecosystems by outcompeting local wildlife for resources or preying on them directly. This approach reduces reliance on more harmful control methods such as toxic pesticides which can harm non target species too. It also offers a sustainable food source that doesn\u2019t put pressure on already vulnerable native animal populations turning an ecological problem into a practical benefit.\n******\nHunting and eating invasive species isn\u2019t always ethically sound because it could create incentives for people to intentionally introduce or spread these species in new areas to profit from hunting or selling them as food. This would worsen the original ecological problem instead of solving it. Additionally focusing solely on hunting as a solution can distract from addressing the root causes of invasive species introductions such as careless trade practices or habitat disruption. There\u2019s also a risk of consuming these species if they carry harmful pathogens or have accumulated toxins that pose health risks to humans."}

You\u2019re standing in line with women who marched for suffrage, Black Americans who crossed bridges to vote, immigrants who dreamed of a voice in their new home. This is our democracy\u2014messy, imperfect, but ours\u2014and it\u2019s up to each of us to nurture it, one vote, one conversation, one act of respect at a time. Thank you.\""}

{"prompt": "What's the best way to get to the train station? Answer using a casual tone and markdown. Your response should be at least 300 words and in all lowercase letters.", "response": "alright, let\u2019s break this down\u2014getting to the train station doesn\u2019t have to be a chaotic last-minute sprint, promise. the \u201cbest way\u201d depends a little on where you\u2019re coming from, how much stuff you\u2019re hauling, and if you\u2019re trying to save cash or time, but i\u2019ve got you covered for all scenarios, with my top picks front and center.\n\n### if you\u2019re prioritizing cheap + low-stress (my absolute go-to)\nif you live within a 10-minute walk of a bus stop or light rail station that goes direct to the train station, this is chef\u2019s kiss. no parking fees, no circling the block 10 times looking for a spot, no white-knuckling the steering wheel while stuck in a traffic jam that\u2019s definitely going to make you miss your train.\n\nmost cities have apps like transit or google maps that give real-time arrival updates, so you don\u2019t have to stand on a freezing corner at 6am guessing when the bus will show up. last month, i had to catch a 7am train to visit my cousin, and the bus arrived exactly when the app said it would\u2014i even had time to grab a warm cinnamon roll from the station\u2019s tiny bakery before boarding. pro tip: if you\u2019re carrying a big suitcase or a duffel bag, look for buses with bike racks or wheelchair access\u2014they usually have more open space for luggage, and drivers are almost always cool with you stashing it by the front door if the bus isn\u2019t packed. also, if you\u2019re a frequent traveler, get a monthly transit pass\u2014it\u2019ll save you a ton of cash in the long run, and you won\u2019t have to fumble with exact change every time you ride.\n\n### if you\u2019re running late or have tons of luggage\nride-sharing (uber, lyft, or your local equivalent) is the emergency backup that never lets you down. once, i missed my bus because i got distracted watching a compilation of golden retrievers playing fetch, and i had 20 minutes to get to the station. i ordered an uber, and the driver took a secret back route that skipped the downtown rush hour mess\u2014i made it with 5 minutes to spare, and even had time to sprint to the bathroom before boarding.\n\nbut heads up: surge pricing is real. if you\u2019re trying to get to the station during rush hour, a holiday weekend, or after a big concert, the price can double or even triple. always check the estimated fare before you confirm the ride. also, if you have multiple big suitcases or a guitar case or something weird like that, make sure to select the \u201cxl\u201d option or note it in the request so the driver has enough space. some drivers even help you load your luggage, which is a lifesaver when you\u2019re juggling a suitcase, a backpack, and a reusable water bottle that\u2019s leaking all over your travel notes.\n\n### if you\u2019re driving (only if you really have to)\ndriving to the train station is the last resort for me, but sometimes you don\u2019t have a choice\u2014like if you\u2019re traveling with a group of people or you live super far from any public transit stops. the biggest mistake people make is not pre-booking parking. i once drove around the station\u2019s parking garage for 15 minutes looking for a spot, and by the time i found one, my train was already gone. never again.\n\nso if you have to drive, book a parking spot online ahead of time. most train stations have official parking garages with pre-paid spots, or you can use apps like spothero to find cheaper off-site parking that\u2019s a short shuttle ride to the station. pro tip: if you\u2019re leaving for more than a day, look for long-term parking lots\u2014they\u2019re way cheaper than daily rates. and don\u2019t forget to take a photo of your parking spot number and the garage entrance, so you don\u2019t spend 20 minutes wandering around like a lost tourist when you get back home.\n\nat the end of the day, the best way is whatever fits your situation. but if you\u2019re not sure, pull up google maps, plug in your start time, and use the \u201carrive by\u201d option\u2014it\u2019ll show you all the possible routes with estimated times and costs. and remember: always leave a little extra buffer time. you never know when a bus will be late, a cat will cross your path and make you stop to pet it, or you\u2019ll realize you forgot your train ticket and have to run back home. better safe than sorry, right?"}

Let\u2019s assign each of the 11 results a squishy label: \\( x_1, x_2, ..., x_{11} \\) (each is a wiggly number blob that hates being alone).\n\nFirst, the big boss average juice tells us the total sum goop of all 11 blobs is:\n\\( S_{\\text{total}} = 11 \\times 51 = 561 \\) (that\u2019s like squeezing 11 blobs into one giant goop ball weighing 561 units).\n\nNext, the first five blobs (the tiny front squad) have an average juice of 49, so their combined sum goop is:\n\\( S_{\\text{front5}} = 5 \\times 49 = 245 \\) (a medium goop ball made of the first five squishies).\n\nThen, the last nine blobs (the lanky back crew) have an average juice of 52\u2014wait, hold on, 5 + 9 =14 blobs, but we only have 11! That means three blobs are double-dipped in both the front squad and back crew (they\u2019re the overlap squishies: \\( x_3, x_4, x_5 \\)). Their combined sum goop is:\n\\( S_{\\text{back9}} =9 \\times52=468 \\) (a huge goop ball that includes the overlap squishies twice).\n\nNow, if we mash the front5 goop and back9 goop together, we get a mega goop that\u2019s the total sum plus the overlap squishies (since those three were counted twice):\n\\( S_{\\text{front5}} + S_{\\text{back9}} = S_{\\text{total}} + S_{\\text{overlap3}} \\)\n\nPlug in the numbers:\n\\(245 +468=561 + S_{\\text{overlap3}}\\)\n\\(713=561 + S_{\\text{overlap3}}\\)\nSubtract the total goop from both sides:\n\\( S_{\\text{overlap3}}=713-561=152 \\) (so the three double-dipped blobs weigh 152 units total).\n\nBut wait\u2014you asked for the sixth blob (\\(x_6\\))! Where is it? Well, the sixth blob is part of the back crew but not the front squad (it\u2019s a solo squish in the back). We know the sum of all blobs from sixth to eleventh is:\n\\( S_{\\text{6-11}}=S_{\\text{total}} - S_{\\text{front5}}=561-245=316 \\) (a goop ball of the six back-end solo squishies).\n\nBut here\u2019s the catch: we can\u2019t squeeze out just the sixth blob from this goop ball! There are five other blobs (\\(x_7\\) to \\(x_{11}\\)) mixed in, and we have no info about their squishy weights. The sixth blob could be 50, 100, even 0 (if the others carry the load)\u2014we can\u2019t pin down its exact value with the given average juices.\n\nP.P.S. If you sneakily swap the numbers to say \u201cfirst nine have an average of 49 and last five have an average of 52,\u201d you can find the sum of the overlapping blobs (including the sixth one), but as per your original riddle, the sixth blob is a slippery little squish that won\u2019t reveal itself without more clues. Also, if you feed the overlap squishies a snack, they might grow to an average of 50.666, but that still doesn\u2019t help with the sixth guy."}

One day, they went out kayaking early in the morning, and a sudden storm rolled in. By the time search teams found their kayak, they were nowhere to be seen. I remember feeling like my chest was tight all the time, like I couldn\u2019t catch my breath. I\u2019d walk past our favorite swimming hole and just stand there, staring at the water, wondering how something that had always felt like a place of joy could take them from me. For weeks, I avoided talking about them, scared that if I said their name out loud, it would make it real. But then, one day, their mom gave me a box of their old things\u2014including a worn-out copy of our favorite book, with notes in the margins we\u2019d written to each other as kids. That\u2019s when I started to open up. I\u2019d sit on my porch and read those notes, or tell stories about them to anyone who would listen. Slowly, the sharp, raw hurt started to soften into something more gentle\u2014a quiet longing, but also a warm reminder of all the love we\u2019d shared.\n\nI know right now it might feel like this pain will never end, but I promise you, as time goes on, you\u2019ll start to feel their presence in the little moments that matter. When you hear a song they loved, or see a sunset that looks just like the ones you watched together, you\u2019ll smile through the tears, because you\u2019ll know they\u2019re still with you in those memories. You don\u2019t have to be strong right now. Just take it one moment at a time, and know that I\u2019m here with you every step of the way."}

By relocating to a country where your target language is spoken, you\u2019ll be surrounded by authentic, real-world usage at every turn: from ordering pastries at a neighborhood boulangerie to chatting with local shopkeepers or joining community gatherings. These unscripted interactions teach you colloquial phrases, natural intonation, and cultural context that textbooks and online courses can\u2019t replicate. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be speaking with the fluency, authenticity, and confidence of a native speaker.\n\n### Alternative 1\nIf you\u2019re determined to master a new language and truly connect with its cultural roots, there\u2019s no better method than living where the language is spoken. When you\u2019re immersed in daily life\u2014haggling at bustling markets, attending local festivals, or even just watching evening news without subtitles\u2014you absorb the language organically, not as a set of rigid rules but as a living, evolving part of the community. This constant exposure trains your ear to catch subtle accents and slang, and before long, you\u2019ll find yourself conversing with the ease and naturalness of someone who\u2019s grown up with the language.\n\n### Alternative 2\nDreaming of speaking a new language like a native? The key lies in full, unfiltered immersion. Pack your bags and move to a country where the language is spoken, and you\u2019ll turn your learning goals into reality faster than you think. Instead of memorizing vocabulary lists in isolation, you\u2019ll learn to ask for directions when lost, laugh at local inside jokes, and share personal stories with native speakers\u2014all while picking up the rhythm and cultural subtleties that make the language feel alive. In a surprisingly short time, you\u2019ll transition from stilted sentences to fluent, meaningful conversations, with a deep understanding of the culture that shapes every word you say.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}

By framing \"being a good friend\" as a counterpoint to \"not very intelligent,\" it reinforces a false dichotomy\u2014friendship often thrives on qualities like empathy, reliability, loyalty, or shared joy, which have no inherent link to traditional measures of intelligence. \n\nThe phrase \"not very intelligent\" is also frustratingly vague: it provides no context about what specific skills or capacities are being referenced (e.g., academic aptitude, practical problem-solving, emotional awareness?), making the judgment feel arbitrary and ungrounded. Worse, it reduces Werner to two surface-level traits, ignoring the full spectrum of his experiences, strengths, and quirks that likely made the friendship meaningful in the first place. Such a statement risks trivializing both the value of the friendship and the richness of Werner as an individual, framing intelligence as a defining, negative characteristic rather than one of many overlapping facets of a person."}
{"prompt": "Gideon is a farmer who has a surplus of crops from his farm this year. What might he do with that surplus? Highlight at least one section of your answer in markdown, i.e *highlighted section*.", "response": "Gideon has several practical and strategic options for his surplus crops, depending on his goals for profit, community impact, or future security:\n\n1. **Sell to local markets or distributors**: He could take the surplus to a nearby farmers\u2019 market, where he might get a premium price from customers who value fresh, local produce. Alternatively, he could partner with a regional food distributor to sell larger quantities to grocery stores, restaurants, or schools, ensuring a steady bulk income.\n\n2. **Donate to community food initiatives**: Donating surplus crops to local food banks, soup kitchens, or community gardens can help address food insecurity in his area. Beyond the social good, this may also qualify him for tax deductions, reducing his overall tax burden at the end of the year.\n\n*3. Process into value-added products to boost profitability*: Instead of selling raw crops at commodity prices, Gideon could invest in small-scale processing to turn his surplus into higher-margin goods. For example, if he has excess tomatoes, he can make salsa, tomato sauce, or sun-dried tomatoes; surplus grains can be milled into artisanal flour or baked into bread; and extra fruits can be turned into jams, jellies, or fruit leather. These products not only have a longer shelf life than raw produce, reducing waste, but they also allow him to brand his goods and sell them at a significant markup\u2014either at farmers\u2019 markets, online, or through local retailers. Over time, this could even grow into a side business that complements his annual harvest, diversifying his income streams and making his farm more resilient to market fluctuations.\n\n4. **Store for future use or sale**: If he has access to proper storage facilities (like climate-controlled silos, root cellars, or freezers), Gideon can preserve the surplus to use as feed for his livestock during lean months, or sell it later when supply is low and prices are higher. This is especially useful for staple crops like corn, wheat, or potatoes, which can be stored for extended periods with the right conditions.\n\n5. **Barter with other farmers**: He could trade his surplus crops for goods or services he needs on the farm. For instance, excess vegetables might be swapped for hay from a neighboring livestock farmer, or for repairs to his farming equipment from a local mechanic who values fresh produce. Bartering helps him avoid cash transactions while meeting critical farm needs.\n\nEach choice aligns with different priorities, but processing into value-added products stands out as a way to turn surplus into a long-term revenue opportunity rather than a one-time sale."}

By centering nonpartisan research from the [mental health research institute at Stanford University] and comparative insights from [historical presidential administration], the paper argues that targeted institutional support and evidence-based adaptive practices can enhance presidential effectiveness while upholding the integrity of the executive branch.\n\n## Introduction  \nSince the nation\u2019s founding, the presidency has evolved from a relatively constrained executive role to a global steward of U.S. interests, carrying with it a scope of demands that expand with each shift in domestic and global dynamics. Popular discourse often focuses on the ceremonial and symbolic dimensions of the office, but academic scholarship increasingly emphasizes the unrelenting nature of the tasks that fill a president\u2019s daily schedule\u2014from classified briefings to constituent outreach. This paper explores how modern presidents navigate these persistent demands, focusing on four core domains: public mandate fulfillment, administrative interbranch collaboration, diplomatic global leadership, and personal adaptive practices. By avoiding normative judgments and centering empirical analysis, this work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how the office\u2019s structure and the president\u2019s individual strategies shape policy outcomes and long-term institutional resilience.\n\n## 1. Public Mandate and Constituent Engagement  \nA president\u2019s legitimacy rests on their ability to align actions with the priorities of diverse constituent groups, a task that requires constant, context-aware engagement. For example, a president might begin a week by visiting a [rural Midwest congressional district] to discuss agricultural infrastructure funding, then travel to [urban coastal tech hub] to address workforce development in the AI sector. These engagements are complemented by formal communications, such as delivering a [national address on climate resilience] or participating in a [weekly press briefing with the White House Press Secretary], where clarity and consistency are paramount to maintaining public trust.  \n\nBeyond direct constituent interaction, presidents must coordinate with legislative allies to advance key priorities, such as shepherding [executive order on supply chain stability] through congressional oversight hearings via the [White House Office of Legislative Affairs]. The [cross-partisan congressional caucus on executive branch efficiency] has noted that successful public mandate fulfillment depends on balancing short-term constituent needs with long-term policy goals, a task that requires daily prioritization of competing requests from local officials, advocacy groups, and national party leaders.\n\n## 2. Administrative Coordination and Interbranch Collaboration  \nThe executive branch oversees over 400 federal agencies, making administrative coordination a core daily challenge for presidents. This includes leading regular meetings with cabinet secretaries to implement [post-pandemic economic recovery framework], as well as mediating disputes between agencies like the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency over renewable energy regulations. Interbranch collaboration is equally critical: presidents must work with congressional leaders to avoid gridlock, such as negotiating with the [Senate Committee on Appropriations] to secure funding for [international coalition for cyber defense].  \n\nIndependent research from the [independent commission on presidential workload] has found that modern presidents spend an average of 6 hours daily on administrative and legislative coordination tasks, a figure that has risen 30% since the 1990s due to the expansion of federal regulatory scope. To address this, some presidents have established specialized teams, such as the [White House Office of Regulatory Reform], to streamline agency reporting and reduce redundant meetings.\n\n## 3. Diplomatic Stewardship and Global Interdependence  \nIn an era of global interdependence, presidents must act as stewards of U.S. global interests, balancing bilateral partnerships with multilateral cooperation. For instance, a president might attend a [bilateral trade summit in Tokyo] to renegotiate terms for agricultural exports, then participate in a virtual meeting with the [G7 leaders\u2019 summit on global health security] to coordinate vaccine distribution in sub-Saharan Africa. Daily classified briefings, such as the [classified intelligence briefing on Arctic security], provide critical context for these decisions, requiring presidents to synthesize complex, rapidly changing information to guide diplomatic strategy.  \n\nDiplomatic success also depends on maintaining credibility with allies and adversaries alike. For example, advancing the [international coalition for cyber defense] requires consistent engagement with partners like [NATO headquarters in Brussels] to align on response protocols for cyberattacks. The [2023 U.S. National Security Strategy] emphasizes that diplomatic stewardship requires presidents to balance assertiveness with empathy, a skill honed through regular interactions with foreign ambassadors and participation in events like the [annual United Nations General Assembly address].\n\n## 4. Personal Adaptive Practices and Institutional Support  \nTo sustain effectiveness across these domains, presidents rely on a combination of personal adaptive practices and institutional support systems. Many modern presidents prioritize regular physical activity, such as morning jogs or golf at [presidential retreat at Camp David], to maintain cognitive clarity. The [nonpartisan presidential wellness task force] has recommended integrating evidence-based practices, such as 20-minute daily mindfulness sessions, into presidential schedules, a strategy adopted by several recent administrations.  \n\nInstitutional support also plays a key role. The [White House Medical Unit] provides personalized health monitoring, while the [Office of the First Lady] often leads initiatives to promote public wellness, such as the [Let\u2019s Move!] campaign (adapted for modern contexts). Additionally, presidents can draw on insights from the [mental health research institute at Stanford University], which has published guidelines on maintaining cognitive resilience in high-demand leadership roles.\n\n## 5. Comparative Analysis with [Historical Presidential Administration]  \nA comparative analysis with the [Eisenhower administration] reveals how presidential demands have evolved over time. Eisenhower\u2019s daily logs, held in the [Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library], show that he spent 40% of his time on military and diplomatic tasks, compared to 60% for modern presidents, reflecting the expansion of U.S. global leadership since the Cold War. However, Eisenhower\u2019s use of a [staff of 200+ White House aides] to delegate administrative tasks offers a model for modern presidents seeking to streamline their workload\u2014a strategy echoed in the [executive order on executive branch efficiency] signed in 2023.\n\n## Conclusion  \nThe U.S. presidency is defined by persistent, multifaceted demands that require a combination of strategic prioritization, institutional support, and personal adaptive practices. This analysis has shown that presidents navigate these challenges across public, administrative, diplomatic, and personal domains, drawing on both historical precedents and contemporary research to enhance their effectiveness. To further support presidential performance, policymakers should expand the mandate of the [nonpartisan presidential wellness task force] to include regular workload assessments, and update the [independent commission on presidential workload] recommendations to address the unique demands of the 21st century, such as social media engagement and rapid global crisis response. By investing in these institutional and personal support systems, the U.S. can ensure that its presidents are equipped to uphold the nation\u2019s values and advance its interests for generations to come.\n\n## References  \n1.

You only have time for 3 one-on-one chats before the vote, and each council member has strict conversational triggers, alliances, and grudges that shape their decision:\n\n1. Alice: Hates jargon; will only support you if you can prove at least two other members are already on board.\n2. Bob: A former teacher who prioritizes youth programs; will support you if you mention the hub\u2019s after-school tutoring\u2014but he\u2019ll oppose you if you talk to Charlie first (they had a falling out over a budget dispute).\n3. Charlie: A small business owner; will support you if you promise to promote local shops at the hub\u2014but he\u2019ll only listen if you\u2019ve already chatted with Dana (she\u2019s his mentor).\n4. Dana: An environmentalist; will support you if you commit to solar panels on the hub\u2014no exceptions.\n5. Eve: A swing voter; will mirror the majority of the members you\u2019ve already chatted with (if you talked to 2 supporters, she supports; if 1 supporter and 1 opponent, she abstains; if 2 opponents, she opposes).\n6. Frank: A retiree who values tradition; will support you only if you don\u2019t talk to Eve (he thinks she\u2019s too \u2018fickle\u2019).\n7. Grace: The mayor; will support you if at least one of the \u2018old guard\u2019 (Frank or Bob) is on your side.\n\n### Logical Question:\nWhich three council members should you chat with, in what specific order, to guarantee that at least 5 of the 7 will vote in favor of your hub? And walk through the logical chain that proves your choice works.\n\n*Critical Reasoning Breakdown:*  \nThe optimal sequence is **Dana \u2192 Charlie \u2192 Bob**, and here\u2019s why it locks in 6+ votes:  \n1. Chat with Dana first: Commit to solar panels (her non-negotiable), so she immediately supports you.  \n2. Chat with Charlie next: Since you\u2019ve already spoken to his mentor Dana, he\u2019ll listen. Promise to promote local shops, and he supports you.  \n3. Chat with Bob last: Mention the after-school tutoring program (his priority), and he supports you\u2014*and* since you didn\u2019t talk to Charlie first, you avoid triggering his grudge against Charlie.  \n\nNow, map the rest of the votes:  \n- Alice: You can prove three members (Dana, Charlie, Bob) are on board\u2014she supports you.  \n- Grace: Bob is part of the \"old guard\" and supports you\u2014she supports you.  \n- Frank: You never spoke to Eve, so he supports you (he sees her as fickle).  \n- Eve: You chatted with three supporters, so she mirrors that majority and supports you.  \n\nThe only way this could fail is if you mixed up the order (e.g., Charlie before Dana, or Bob before Charlie), but this sequence avoids all conflicts and triggers cascading support from every member\u2014securing all 7 votes, which easily meets your 5-vote goal.\""}

{"prompt": "Write a blog post about how to train a dog that is geared towards kids. Include the keywords \"finale\" and \"less\" in the post.", "response": "# How to Train Your Dog (For Kids!): Fun Tricks, Happy Pups, and an Awesome Finale  \n\nImagine calling your dog over, and they plop right at your feet, lift a paw to shake, then roll over like a fuzzy little log. How cool would that be? Training your dog isn\u2019t just about tricks\u2014it\u2019s about bonding with your best friend and making every moment together fun. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to teach your pup something new, keep reading: we\u2019ve got easy steps, tips to keep it low-stress (and less frustrating!), and even how to plan a showstopping finale to show off all your hard work.  \n\n## 1. Start with Tiny Wins (and Less Rushing)  \nFirst rule of dog training: don\u2019t jump into big tricks on day one. Less rushing means more wins, and more wins mean more fun. You don\u2019t need to teach your dog to jump through hoops or fetch a soda can right away. Start with the simplest trick ever: sit. Hold a treat above their head, and when their bottom hits the floor, say \u201cSit!\u201d and give them the treat. Do this a few times, and before you know it, they\u2019ll sit when you ask.  \n\nLess frustration comes from celebrating these tiny wins instead of worrying about perfecting a huge trick. Remember: your dog doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re a \u201cperfect\u201d trainer\u2014they just care about spending time with you.  \n\n## 2. Treats = Magic (But Less Overdoing It)  \nTreats are like doggy gold\u2014they help your pup know they did something great. But here\u2019s a secret: less overfeeding is key. If you give too many treats, your dog might get full and stop caring, or even gain too much weight. Stick to small, healthy treats: tiny pieces of apple, carrot sticks, or store-bought training treats that are made to be bite-sized. One treat per correct trick is perfect\u2014enough to keep them excited, but less likely to make them feel sluggish.  \n\n## 3. Speak Their Language (Less Confusing Words)  \nDogs don\u2019t understand long, fancy sentences. Less confusion means faster learning. Use short, clear commands: \u201cSit!\u201d not \u201cCan you please sit down for me, buddy?\u201d \u201cShake!\u201d not \u201cWould you mind lifting your paw so we can shake hands?\u201d  \n\nAnd be consistent! If you use \u201cSit!\u201d one day and \u201cPark it!\u201d the next, your dog will be confused. Stick to the same words every time, and you\u2019ll see them catch on way quicker.  \n\n## 4. Practice Makes Perfect (But Less Long Sessions)  \nDogs have short attention spans\u2014just like you might get bored during a long homework session. Less time per practice means more fun for both of you. Keep training sessions 5-10 minutes long, 2-3 times a day. That\u2019s enough time to teach a small part of a trick without your pup getting tired or grumpy.  \n\nIf your dog starts wandering off or licking their paws, it\u2019s time to take a break. Go play fetch or give them a hug\u2014you can try again later!  \n\n## 5. Plan a Finale to Show Off Your Skills!  \nOnce you and your dog have mastered a few tricks (think: sit, shake, roll over, and maybe even \u201cplay dead\u201d), it\u2019s time to plan a finale! A finale is your chance to show off all your hard work to family, friends, or even your pet hamster.  \n\nHere\u2019s how to make it awesome:  \n- Pick a sequence of tricks that flow together: Start with \u201cSit!\u201d then \u201cShake!\u201d with both paws, then \u201cRoll Over!\u201d and finish with a big, cozy hug (or a high-five if your dog is into that).  \n- Ask a grown-up to help set up a little \u201cstage\u201d\u2014maybe a blanket on the living room floor or a spot in the backyard.  \n- Invite your audience, and don\u2019t forget to cheer for your dog every step of the way.  \n\nAfter the finale, give your pup a super special reward: a new chew toy, a big bowl of their favorite kibble, or extra belly rubs. The finale isn\u2019t just about showing off\u2014it\u2019s about celebrating the bond you\u2019ve built with your dog.  \n\n## Wrapping Up  \nTraining your dog is all about having fun, being patient, and taking it one step at a time. Less rushing, less confusion, and less frustration will make every session feel like a game. And when you plan that awesome finale, you\u2019ll see that all the small moments add up to something amazing.  \n\nSo grab your treats, call your dog over, and let\u2019s start training\u2014your big finale is waiting! \ud83d\udc3e"}

Competing in the First Division, they were led by Clive Allen, whose 49 goals across all competitions that season remains a club record, propelling them to the FA Cup final. Though they fell short against Wimbledon in that final and finished 13th in the league, their attacking firepower and depth were unmatched by lower-league sides like Stockton. A dedicated fan named Gao, who had relocated to London from Beijing the prior year, quickly became a staple at White Hart Lane, his unwavering support a small but vivid example of the team\u2019s ability to resonate with fans from diverse backgrounds.\n\nStockton, a non-league side in the Northern League during 1987-88, operated on a fraction of Tottenham\u2019s budget and had a fraction of their national visibility. Yet the hearts of their local supporters beat fiercely for the team, with fans packing their modest stadium for every home match and traveling long distances to cheer them on in away fixtures. They had a tight-knit squad of hardworking players who played with grit, but they lacked the elite training facilities, transfer budget, and top-tier experience that defined Tottenham\u2019s setup. While their season was marked by small, hard-earned victories against regional rivals, they never faced the level of competition that Tottenham navigated week in and week out.\n\nBonding between players and fans was a cornerstone of both teams\u2019 identities, but Tottenham\u2019s broader reach meant this connection extended far beyond their local community. For fans like Gao, bonding with fellow supporters in the stands at White Hart Lane created lasting memories, as they debated tactics, celebrated Allen\u2019s goals, and commiserated over the FA Cup final loss. Stockton\u2019s bonding, meanwhile, was deeply rooted in their hometown, where players often joined fans at local pubs after matches, forging personal ties that felt like family. Still, when evaluating overall team quality, success, and impact, Tottenham\u2019s 1987-88 squad was undeniably the better team, with a level of talent and achievement that Stockton could not match.\n\nP.P.S: If you ever get the chance to dive into the lesser-known corners of 1980s English football, Stockton\u2019s 1987-88 season offers a heartwarming glimpse into the passion that fuels non-league clubs\u2014proof that football\u2019s most meaningful moments aren\u2019t always tied to silverware."}

{"prompt": "Is Grafton, Vermont a good place to live? Write exactly 3 paragraphs each separated with two new lines answering this question. The first paragraph must start with \"send\".", "response": "Send anyone craving a quiet, postcard-perfect New England lifestyle to Grafton, Vermont, and they\u2019ll likely fall in love immediately. Nestled in the Green Mountains, this tiny town (population just over 600) is surrounded by rolling hills, dense forests, and iconic covered bridges that look straight out of a storybook. The pace of life here is unhurried: neighbors wave from porches, local shops like the Grafton Village Cheese Company draw both residents and visitors with artisanal goods, and seasonal events like the fall foliage festival or winter ice carving contests bring the community together. For those who value nature, hiking trails wind through the nearby Grafton Ponds State Park, and cross-country skiing or snowshoeing is a favorite winter pastime. It\u2019s a place where you know your barista by name and where community matters more than keeping up with the latest trends.\n\n\nOf course, Grafton isn\u2019t without its challenges, and it\u2019s not for everyone. The job market is small, with most local positions tied to tourism, agriculture, or small businesses, so those seeking a career in tech or corporate fields may need to work remotely or commute to larger cities like Brattleboro or Keene, New Hampshire, which are 30 to 45 minutes away. The cost of living is also higher than the national average, particularly for housing, as historic homes and land in the area are in high demand. Winters can be long and harsh, with heavy snowfall that sometimes makes travel tricky, though the town\u2019s tight-knit community often steps in to help neighbors clear driveways or share supplies. For those who can adapt to these quirks, however, the trade-off is a quality of life that\u2019s hard to find in busier areas\u2014less traffic, cleaner air, and a sense of safety where kids can play outside without constant supervision.\n\n\nFor many residents, Grafton\u2019s greatest strength is its ability to feel both timeless and welcoming to new faces. The town has attracted a mix of lifelong Vermonters, retirees seeking a peaceful retreat, and young families drawn to the small, personalized public school system. Organizations like the Grafton Foundation work to preserve the town\u2019s historic architecture and support sustainable agriculture, ensuring that its character remains intact for future generations. Whether you\u2019re sipping maple syrup at a local farm, attending a town meeting where every voice is heard, or simply watching the sunset over the Green Mountains, Grafton offers a sense of belonging that\u2019s rare in today\u2019s fast-paced world. It\u2019s not just a place to live\u2014it\u2019s a community to be part of, and for those who fit, it\u2019s nothing short of perfect."}

Also, make sure the letter o appears at least 25 times in your response.", "response": "\"1. Generative AI\u2019s Omnipresence: Generative AI tools like large language models (LLMs) are no longer niche\u2014they\u2019re transforming every corner of tech, from content creation to code generation, customer support to drug discovery. Organizations across all sectors are adopting these tools to boost productivity, optimize operations, and open up new opportunities for innovation. The ongoing evolution of multimodal models, which can process text, images, audio, and video, is driving even more adoption, as they offer more holistic and intuitive solutions for users worldwide.\n\n2. Edge Computing\u2019s Explosive Growth: As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand, edge computing is becoming critical to reducing latency, optimizing bandwidth usage, and ensuring real-time data processing. More and more devices\u2014from smart home appliances to industrial sensors\u2014are generating massive amounts of data, and processing this data closer to its origin (instead of sending it to distant cloud servers) is essential for efficient, reliable operations. This trend is also opening doors for new use cases in areas like autonomous vehicles, remote healthcare monitoring, and smart city operations, where split-second decisions are non-negotiable.\n\n3. Sustainable Tech\u2019s Global Push: With growing awareness of climate change, tech companies are prioritizing sustainability in every aspect of their operations\u2014from designing energy-efficient hardware to optimizing cloud data centers to reduce their carbon footprint. Green tech innovations like solar-powered data centers, recyclable device components, and AI-driven energy management systems are gaining traction, as organizations and consumers alike demand more eco-friendly options. This trend is not just about reducing harm; it\u2019s also about creating new business models centered around circularity and environmental responsibility.\n\n4. Metaverse & Spatial Computing\u2019s Ongoing Evolution: The metaverse, though still in its early stages, is evolving rapidly, with spatial computing technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) becoming more accessible and integrated into daily life. From immersive training programs in corporate settings to interactive educational experiences and virtual social gatherings, these technologies are redefining how we connect, work, and play. Tech giants and startups alike are investing heavily in developing more intuitive, high-quality AR/VR devices and platforms, aiming to make spatial computing a mainstream part of our digital lives.\n\n5. IoT\u2019s Unstoppable Expansion: The number of connected IoT devices is projected to grow exponentially in the coming years, with everything from smart wearables to agricultural drones joining the network. This expansion is driving innovation in areas like predictive maintenance for industrial equipment, smart agriculture systems that optimize water and fertilizer usage, and connected healthcare devices that enable remote patient monitoring. As more devices come online, the need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect this interconnected ecosystem becomes even more urgent, leading to parallel growth in IoT security solutions.\""}

Many of these groups actively seek authentic insignia to curate exhibits that honor service members and educate the public about military history. When reaching out, ask about their formal adoption process for new collections\u2014some may require an inventory of your items to ensure they align with their mission of preserving and sharing military stories. Additionally, inquire about guidelines for the safe carriage of your insignia, as delicate or vintage pieces might need padded containers or climate-controlled transport to prevent damage during delivery. This not only gives your collection a purposeful second life but also ensures it\u2019s cared for by those who understand its significance.\n******\n<<Rehome via Military Enthusiast Communities or Collector Networks>>\nAnother effective approach is to connect with military memorabilia collector communities, either online (through specialized forums, social media groups, or dedicated collector websites) or in-person at military shows and swap meets. Many enthusiasts are eager to add authentic insignia to their personal collections, and some groups run structured adoption programs where members can request pieces that hold personal or historical meaning to them. Before finalizing any transfer, clarify the adoption terms\u2014whether it\u2019s a gift, sale, or trade\u2014and coordinate the safe carriage of your items. For valuable or fragile insignia, opt for tracked shipping with protective packaging, or arrange for in-person carriage if the recipient is local. This method ensures your collection goes to someone who will appreciate and preserve each piece for years to come."}

Nick Carraway, a wide-eyed Midwestern transplant who moved to Long Island to make his fortune on Wall Street\u2014only to stumble into a web of lies that would change his life forever. Carraway\u2019s tiny cottage sat next door to the estate of Jay Gatsby, the mysterious millionaire who threw parties so over-the-top, champagne flowed like water and A-listers flocked to his gates\u2026 even though no one knew where his stacks of cash came from.\n\nTurns out, Gatsby\u2019s rags-to-riches tale was a sham wrapped in silk. Born James Gatz, a poor farm boy from North Dakota, he\u2019d spent years clawing his way to the top for one reason: to win back Daisy Buchanan, Carraway\u2019s own cousin. Daisy, a blonde bombshell trapped in a loveless marriage to brute old-money heir Tom Buchanan, had a steamy fling with Gatsby before he shipped off to WWI. But when he returned penniless, she married Tom for his family name and fat bank account.\n\nGatsby didn\u2019t give up. He bought his palatial mansion across the bay from Daisy\u2019s East Egg home, staring every night at the green light at the end of her dock like a lovesick puppy. And when Carraway agreed to play matchmaker, the pair rekindled their forbidden affair\u2014sneaking around behind Tom\u2019s back while Gatsby dreamed of a perfect future with his golden girl.\n\nBut Tom wasn\u2019t about to let his wife go without a fight. He\u2019d been cheating on Daisy with Myrtle Wilson, a fiery redhead married to a hapless gas station owner stuck in the desolate Valley of Ashes. When Tom uncovered Gatsby and Daisy\u2019s secret, he exploded in a shocking hotel showdown, spilling Gatsby\u2019s dirtiest secret: his fortune wasn\u2019t from legitimate business\u2014it was from bootlegging booze and cutting deals with gangsters!\n\nDaisy, caught between the two men, cracked. That night, she hopped behind the wheel of Gatsby\u2019s sleek roadster, with Gatsby beside her, and careened into Myrtle\u2014killing her instantly. But instead of taking responsibility, Daisy let Gatsby take the fall.\n\nThe plot thickened when Tom fed Myrtle\u2019s grief-crazed husband, George Wilson, a deadly lie: he told Wilson that Gatsby was the one who\u2019d been sleeping with Myrtle and killed her. Wilson, driven mad with rage, snuck into Gatsby\u2019s mansion while he floated in his pool and shot him dead before turning the gun on himself.\n\nAnd the ultimate betrayal? When Gatsby\u2019s funeral rolled around, all those party guests who\u2019d drunk his champagne and danced in his halls vanished into thin air. Only Carraway showed up to say goodbye. Daisy and Tom? They packed their bags and skipped town, leaving Gatsby\u2019s body to rot and his dreams to crumble into dust.\n\nCarraway told us, \u201cThey were careless people, Tom and Daisy\u2014they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness\u2026\u201d\n\nSo there you have it: a story of love, lies, and the cold, cruel heart of the Roaring Twenties elite. Gatsby\u2019s dream of winning Daisy was just that\u2014a dream. And in the end, it cost him everything.\n\nRUMOR HAS IT: Gatsby\u2019s famous green light, the one he stared at every night, was just a broken dock lamp. Talk about a metaphor for empty promises!"}

{"prompt": "The opposite of youth is not age, but ...? Highlight at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *highlighted section*.", "response": "The opposite of youth is not age, but a set of rigid, closed-off mindsets that drain the vitality of curiosity and growth. Chronological years may bring physical changes, but youth lives in the willingness to explore, question, and evolve\u2014so its true opposites are states of being that reject these core traits.\n\n*The death of curiosity* is one of the most stark opposites of youth. Youth is defined by a relentless \"why?\"\u2014the urge to touch, taste, and understand the world beyond what\u2019s familiar. A 16-year-old who stops asking questions, who accepts societal norms or personal limitations without pushback, has already lost a critical piece of their youth, even if their body is still young. Conversely, an 85-year-old who takes up stargazing, learns to code, or debates philosophy with strangers retains that youthful spark. Curiosity keeps us engaged with life, making every day feel like a chance to discover something new; when it dies, we slip into a passive, unchanging existence that has nothing to do with how many candles are on our birthday cake.\n\n*The surrender to stagnation* is another powerful counter to youth. Youth thrives on adaptation: it\u2019s the college student switching majors after falling in love with a new subject, the 20-something moving across the country to chase a dream, or the person who apologizes and changes their perspective after a heated argument. Stagnation, by contrast, is the choice to stop growing. It\u2019s the middle-aged professional who says, \u201cI\u2019ve always done it this way, so why change?\u201d or the retiree who refuses to leave their neighborhood because \u201cit\u2019s what I know.\u201d This surrender to routine and fear of change traps us in a mental prison where we stop evolving\u2014something that feels far more \u201cold\u201d than any number of years.\n\nIn the end, age is just a metric of time passed. Youth lives in the courage to stay curious and the humility to keep growing. The moment we abandon those things, we lose the essence of youth\u2014no matter how young we are."}

Depois, percebendo que Ad\u00e3o estava sozinho, Deus fez adormecer o homem e retirou uma de suas costelas para criar Eva, sua companheira.

Deus lhes ordenou que n\u00e3o tocassem nem comessem do fruto dessa \u00e1rvore, advertindo que, se o fizessem, morreriam.\n\nNo entanto, uma serpente, descrita como o mais astuto dos animais, tentou Eva. Ela questionou o comando de Deus, dizendo que eles n\u00e3o morreriam, mas que seus olhos seriam abertos e eles se tornariam como Deus, sabendo o bem e o mal. Eva, atra\u00edda pela promessa de sabedoria, pegou o fruto e comeu, oferecendo parte dele a Ad\u00e3o, que tamb\u00e9m o consumiu.\n\nLogo ap\u00f3s comer o fruto, os dois perceberam que estavam nus e se cobriram com folhas de figueira. Quando Deus apareceu no jardim, eles se esconderam. Ao serem confrontados, Ad\u00e3o culpou Eva, e Eva culpou a serpente. Como consequ\u00eancia de sua desobedi\u00eancia, Deus lan\u00e7ou maldi\u00e7\u00f5es: a serpente seria for\u00e7ada a rastejar pelo ch\u00e3o e inimiga da humanidade; Eva sofreria dores intensas no parto e estaria sujeita \u00e0 autoridade de seu marido; Ad\u00e3o teria que trabalhar duro na terra para obter alimento, enfrentando espinhos e ervas daninhas. Finalmente, Deus expulsou Ad\u00e3o e Eva do \u00c9den, para que eles n\u00e3o comessem tamb\u00e9m do fruto da \u00c1rvore da Vida e vivessem eternamente na sua condi\u00e7\u00e3o imperfeita.\n\nAl\u00e9m da interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o literal, a hist\u00f3ria de Ad\u00e3o e Eva \u00e9 frequentemente analisada como um mito simb\u00f3lico. Muitos estudiosos argumentam que ela representa o momento em que a humanidade adquiriu consci\u00eancia moral, passando de um estado de inoc\u00eancia infantil para a responsabilidade das escolhas. A desobedi\u00eancia n\u00e3o \u00e9 apenas um erro individual, mas sim o in\u00edcio da condi\u00e7\u00e3o humana marcada pela liberdade e pela capacidade de errar.\n\nEssa hist\u00f3ria teve um impacto profundo na cultura ocidental, influenciando obras de arte, literatura, filosofia e \u00e9tica.

{"prompt": "Write a casual summary of the U.S. maternity leave policy with two sections (Section 1 and Section 2) and at least 25 sentences.", "response": "### Section 1: The Federal Baseline (Unpaid, and Not for Everyone)\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered why the U.S. maternity leave situation feels so chaotic compared to other developed countries, start with this hard truth: there\u2019s no federal law that guarantees paid maternity leave. That\u2019s right\u2014unlike almost every other nation in the OECD, the U.S. doesn\u2019t require employers to pay new moms when they take time off to recover from childbirth and bond with their baby. The main federal protection we do have is the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), passed all the way back in 1993. FMLA gives eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year, and it protects their job while they\u2019re gone\u2014meaning their employer can\u2019t fire them or replace them permanently for taking that time. But here\u2019s the big catch: FMLA only applies to a narrow subset of workers. To qualify, you have to have worked for your employer for at least 12 months, put in 1,250 hours of work in the year before taking leave (that\u2019s about 24 hours a week on average), and your employer has to have 50 or more employees within a 75-mile radius. That leaves out a ton of people: part-time workers who don\u2019t hit the 1,250-hour mark, employees at small local businesses with fewer than 50 staff, and even some full-time workers who haven\u2019t been at their job long enough. In fact, only around 56% of private-sector workers in the U.S. are covered by FMLA, according to the Department of Labor. For those who do qualify, the unpaid part is a massive barrier. Most American families live paycheck to paycheck, so taking 12 weeks without any income is simply not feasible for many new moms. Some people try to cobble together time using their accrued sick days, vacation days, or personal days, but not all employers offer those benefits, and even if they do, the days rarely add up to 12 weeks. A lucky few have access to short-term disability insurance through their employer, which can cover some of their wages during the physical recovery period after childbirth\u2014but that\u2019s usually only for the first few weeks, not the bonding time, and it\u2019s not mandatory for employers to offer it. FMLA also applies to paternity leave and adoption leave, but when it comes to maternity, it\u2019s often the only federal safety net\u2014and it\u2019s a pretty flimsy one for a lot of people. Many new moms end up having to go back to work sooner than they want because they can\u2019t afford to take the full 12 weeks unpaid, or they don\u2019t qualify for FMLA at all. For example, a single mom working at a small local caf\u00e9 with 10 employees might not have any job protection or paid leave, so she might have to return to work just a week or two after giving birth to keep her job and pay her rent.\n\n### Section 2: The Patchwork of State and Employer Policies\nSince the federal government hasn\u2019t stepped in to fix the paid leave gap, a growing number of states have taken matters into their own hands. As of 2024, 11 states plus Washington D.C. have implemented some form of paid family and medical leave, which includes maternity leave. These programs are usually funded by small payroll taxes deducted from employees\u2019 paychecks, so they\u2019re not a major burden on employers (for the most part). California was one of the first to launch its Paid Family Leave (PFL) program back in 2004, and it\u2019s become a model for other states. Under California\u2019s PFL, eligible new moms can get between 80% and 90% of their weekly wages (depending on how much they earn) for up to 8 weeks, and that\u2019s recently been extended to 12 weeks for parents who have a baby via surrogacy or adoption, or who need to care for a seriously ill family member. New York\u2019s program, which launched in 2018, gives up to 67% of wages for up to 12 weeks, with plans to increase the percentage and weeks over time. Washington state\u2019s program, which started in 2020, offers up to 90% of wages for up to 12 weeks, with higher replacement rates for lower-income workers to ensure they can actually afford to take the leave. The great thing about these state programs is that they work alongside FMLA\u2014so if you qualify for FMLA, you can take the 12 weeks of unpaid job protection while also getting paid through the state\u2019s program. But here\u2019s the catch: most states still don\u2019t have any paid maternity leave at all. That means if you live in a state like Texas, Florida, or Ohio, you\u2019re stuck relying on whatever your employer offers (if anything) or FMLA\u2019s unpaid leave. Some big companies, like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, have started offering generous paid maternity leave packages\u2014some even give 20+ weeks of fully paid leave, plus other perks like lactation support and childcare stipends. But these benefits are mostly limited to white-collar workers at large corporations; blue-collar workers, retail employees, and those in the gig economy rarely get such generous offers. Even in states with paid leave, there are gaps: for example, some gig workers might not be eligible if they don\u2019t meet the minimum income requirements, or part-time workers might be left out depending on the state\u2019s rules. There\u2019s also a long-standing push for federal paid family leave, like the FAMILY Act, which would create a national program funded by a small payroll tax (0.4% of wages, split between employers and employees) and give up to 12 weeks of paid leave at 66% of wages. But the FAMILY Act has been proposed multiple times in Congress and has never passed, thanks to partisan gridlock. The result is a patchwork system where a new mom\u2019s ability to take paid leave depends entirely on where she lives and who she works for. A teacher in Boston might get 12 weeks of paid leave with 80% of her salary, while a waitress in Atlanta might have to go back to work 3 days after giving birth because she has no paid leave and can\u2019t afford to miss a shift. This inequality has real consequences: mothers who can\u2019t take paid leave are more likely to experience postpartum depression, have lower earnings over their lifetime, and are more likely to drop out of the workforce entirely. On the flip side, studies show that paid maternity leave leads to better health outcomes for babies\u2014like higher breastfeeding rates and lower infant mortality\u2014and helps moms stay connected to their careers. Until the U.S. passes a federal paid maternity leave law, the situation will remain unfair and inconsistent for millions of new moms across the country."}

{"prompt": "Write a description for the Pixel 3A smartphone with at least 400 words. Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"Unveiled in May 2019 as Google\u2019s bold reimagining of the mid-range smartphone, the Pixel 3A wasn\u2019t just an affordable alternative to flagship devices\u2014it was a paradigm shift, proving that premium features could be accessible without a four-figure price tag. Priced at $399 at launch, it filled a critical gap between the high-end Pixel 3 series and generic budget phones, offering a pure Android experience and industry-leading computational photography that outshone many pricier competitors.\n\nDesign-wise, the Pixel 3A opts for a matte polycarbonate body instead of glass or metal, but its curved edges and subtle, non-slip texture give it a solid, refined feel that belies its mid-range status. Available in three eye-catching hues\u2014Just Black, Clearly White, and the fan-favorite Purple-ish\u2014it balances compactness with usability. At 5.6 inches, it\u2019s one of the last truly one-handed-friendly flagship-caliber phones, with slim bezels framing a vibrant 1080p OLED display. Unlike most mid-range devices of its era, which relied on lackluster LCD panels, the Pixel 3A\u2019s OLED delivers deep, inky blacks, rich color saturation, and HDR support that makes streaming Netflix or YouTube feel immersive. The front-facing stereo speakers, tucked into the top and bottom bezels, produce surprisingly loud, clear audio for media consumption, a welcome departure from the tinny speakers common in budget phones.\n\nBut the Pixel 3A\u2019s real crown jewel is its camera system, a masterclass in computational photography that proved software could outperform hardware. Packing the same 12.2MP rear sensor as the flagship Pixel 3, it introduced Google\u2019s revolutionary Night Sight mode to the mid-range market. Before Night Sight, low-light photos were grainy, blurry, or washed out\u2014but this feature used long exposures and AI to stitch together multiple shots, producing bright, detailed images even in near-darkness, no flash required. Portrait mode, too, was a standout: using machine learning to detect subjects and blur backgrounds with precision, it created professional-looking bokeh effects without the need for a second telephoto lens. The 8MP front-facing camera, with a wide-angle lens, was perfect for group selfies, and its software tuning ensured natural skin tones even in harsh light. For photography enthusiasts on a budget, this was a game-changer.\n\nUnder the hood, the Pixel 3A runs on the Snapdragon 670 processor paired with 4GB of RAM\u2014specs that aren\u2019t flagship-level, but thanks to Google\u2019s optimized stock Android software, it delivers smooth performance for daily tasks. Scrolling through social media, streaming 4K video, or playing casual games like *Among Us* feels seamless, with no lag or stuttering. It comes with 64GB of internal storage, and while there\u2019s no expandable slot, Google\u2019s included unlimited original-quality photo and video storage (via Google Photos) at launch mitigated this limitation for most users.\n\nBattery life is another strong suit: the 3000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of heavy use, from streaming music during commutes to video calls and photography. When it\u2019s time to charge, the included 18W fast charger can top up the battery to 50% in just 30 minutes, and it\u2019s compatible with wireless charging via Google\u2019s Pixel Stand\u2014a rare luxury in mid-range phones at the time.\n\nSoftware is where the Pixel 3A truly shines. It launched with stock Android 9 Pie, offering a clean, bloatware-free interface that prioritizes speed and simplicity. Unlike many mid-range devices loaded with carrier or manufacturer bloat, the Pixel 3A lets users focus on what matters, with quick access to Google\u2019s suite of services like Assistant, Maps, and Photos. What\u2019s more, Google committed to three years of OS and security updates, meaning the phone received upgrades to Android 12\u2014an unprecedented level of support for a mid-range device, ensuring it stayed relevant and secure long after its launch.\n\nThe Pixel 3A also included a headphone jack, a feature that was rapidly disappearing from flagship phones in 2019, making it a favorite among audiophiles who preferred wired headphones. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is fast and convenient, unlocking the phone in a split second.\n\nIn the end, the Pixel 3A wasn\u2019t just a great mid-range phone\u2014it redefined what mid-range phones could be. It proved that you don\u2019t need the latest processor or a stack of lenses to get a premium experience; with smart software and intentional design, a more affordable device could compete with the best on the market. For users who valued camera quality, a pure Android experience, and long-term support, the Pixel 3A was the perfect choice, and its legacy lives on in Google\u2019s subsequent A-series devices, which continue to prioritize accessibility without compromising on innovation.\""}

{"prompt": "How can you get to know someone on a deep level in a romantic relationship? The answer should involve the topic of vulnerability. Do not use any commas in your response.", "response": "To get to know someone on a deep level in a romantic relationship you must center vulnerability as the core of genuine connection. Start by opening up about your own unguarded truths such as your quiet fears past hurts or the small unspoken dreams you\u2019ve never shared with others. This act of vulnerability signals to your partner that you trust them enough to show your imperfect self and invites them to let their guard down too. Instead of sticking to surface-level small talk ask thoughtful questions that dig into their core values and inner world like what makes them feel truly seen or what memory still shapes how they love today. When they respond listen fully without rushing to offer solutions or judge their feelings. Hold space for their vulnerability by validating their experiences and sharing how their words resonate with you. Be consistent in this practice even when it feels uncomfortable because deep connection grows when both partners feel safe to be their most authentic selves without fear of rejection. Over time this mutual willingness to be vulnerable will weave a bond built on understanding empathy and the kind of intimacy that goes far beyond surface-level interactions."}

{"prompt": "What are the steps to get the GNSS timestamp on Android? Explain this to teenagers using at least 4 sentences and make sure the letter n appears at least 3 times.", "response": "If you\u2019re curious about getting super precise timing data from satellites\u2014like for a school science project tracking your bike\u2019s speed with nanosecond-level accuracy or building a mini navigation tool\u2014here\u2019s how to grab the GNSS timestamp on your Android phone.\n\nFirst, you need to make sure your phone\u2019s location services are set to high accuracy, because GNSS relies on signals from multiple satellites, and this mode ensures your phone isn\u2019t just using Wi-Fi or cell towers for location data. Head to your Settings app, tap \u201cLocation\u201d, toggle it on, then pick \u201cHigh accuracy\u201d from the mode options. Without this step, you\u2019ll only get your phone\u2019s regular system time, not the precise GNSS timestamp that\u2019s synced to atomic clocks in space.\n\nNext, you can use a free app like GPS Test Plus to easily view the timestamp. Once you download and open it, wait a minute or two for it to connect to enough satellites (you\u2019ll see a number at the top showing how many it\u2019s linked to). Once it has a solid fix, scroll down to the \u201cTiming\u201d section, and you\u2019ll find the GNSS timestamp listed in UTC\u2014a universal time standard that\u2019s the same no matter where you are in the world, so you don\u2019t have to worry about time zone differences messing up your data.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling adventurous and want to get the timestamp for a coding project, you can use Android\u2019s Location API. First, you need to ask for location permissions from the user (that\u2019s a non-negotiable rule for all apps that access location data), then set up a listener that waits for GNSS updates. When a new location fix comes in, the Location object will have a getTime() method that gives you the timestamp in milliseconds since 1970, or getElapsedRealtimeNanos() for even more precise nanosecond data relative to when your phone turned on.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty cool to think that this timestamp comes straight from satellites orbiting 12,000 miles above Earth, and it\u2019s so accurate that it\u2019s used for everything from global navigation to scientific experiments. Whether you\u2019re just curious or working on a project, grabbing the GNSS timestamp is a neat way to learn more about how satellite technology works and how your phone interacts with the world beyond your neighborhood."}

{"prompt": "What is inside Shinto shrines? Imagine that you are giving a lecture to students at a school or university. Use markdown to highlight at least 3 sections of your answer (like this: *highlighted section*). Your answer must also contain at least 3 placeholders (an example of a placeholder is [address]).", "response": "Good morning everyone, and welcome to our session on Shinto shrines\u2014sacred spaces at the heart of Japan\u2019s indigenous spiritual tradition. Today, we\u2019re going beyond the iconic red torii gates to explore what lies inside these revered grounds, breaking down key areas and their significance. Let\u2019s dive in.\n\n### *The Tripartite Sacred Core: Honden, Haiden, and Heiden*  \nAt the very center of most Shinto shrines is a cluster of three interconnected buildings that form the spiritual heart of the space. The **Honden**, or Main Hall, is where the shrine\u2019s kami (deity or sacred spirit) is believed to reside. Unlike many religious sanctuaries open to the public, the Honden is often off-limits to all but shrine priests, who perform daily rituals to honor and care for the kami. For example, at [your local neighborhood shrine in Tokyo], the Honden is a small, unassuming wooden structure tucked behind a bamboo fence, visible only from a distance to maintain its sanctity.  \n\nAdjacent to the Honden is the **Haiden**, or Worship Hall\u2014this is the space where visitors gather to pray, offer incense, and recite wishes. It\u2019s the most accessible part of the sacred core, designed to bridge the gap between humans and kami. Between the Haiden and Honden stands the **Heiden**, or Offerings Hall, where priests present offerings like rice, sake, and seasonal fruits to the kami on behalf of worshippers. During events like [the annual Gion Matsuri in Kyoto], the Heiden becomes a focal point for communal offerings that celebrate the shrine\u2019s protective kami and bring the local community together.\n\n### *Purification Zones: Temizuya and the Path of Respect*  \nBefore approaching the sacred core, visitors must pass through a purification zone to prepare themselves spiritually. The most prominent feature here is the **temizuya**\u2014a stone or wooden basin filled with fresh water, equipped with long-handled ladles. The ritual of temizu involves washing your left hand, then your right hand, cupping water to rinse your mouth (without swallowing), and finally cleaning the ladle\u2019s handle before returning it. This act isn\u2019t just about physical cleanliness; it\u2019s a symbolic way to purify your mind and heart, removing any impurities that might hinder your connection to the kami.  \n\nMany shrines also line the main path (called the sando) with stone lanterns and komainu\u2014mythical lion-dog statues that guard the entrance to the sacred core. These statues are often paired: one with an open mouth to ward off evil, and one with a closed mouth to keep good fortune inside. If you ever join [a student\u2019s first shrine visit during exam season], you\u2019ll notice how worshippers pause at the temizuya with extra care, hoping to clear their minds before praying for academic success.\n\n### *Devotional and Communal Spaces for Visitors*  \nBeyond the sacred core and purification zones, Shinto shrines are filled with spaces that invite worshippers to engage with the tradition in personal, interactive ways. One of the most beloved is the ema stand: wooden plaques where visitors write their wishes\u2014for health, love, or career growth\u2014and hang them up. These wishes are believed to be carried to the kami, and many shrines display ema from past years as a testament to the community\u2019s hopes.  \n\nYou\u2019ll also find stalls selling omamori\u2014small, embroidered talismans that offer protection or good luck. These can be for specific purposes: exam success, safe travel, or even pet health. During festivals, some shrines set up temporary food stalls selling traditional snacks like taiyaki (fish-shaped cakes) and senbei (rice crackers), turning the grounds into a communal gathering space. For many Japanese people, shrines aren\u2019t just places of worship\u2014they\u2019re where families celebrate weddings, children mark their third, fifth, and seventh birthdays (Shichi-Go-San), and communities come together to honor their shared history.\n\nTo wrap up, Shinto shrines are far more than just religious sites\u2014they\u2019re living spaces that blend spirituality, community, and tradition. Whether you\u2019re visiting [your local neighborhood shrine] for a quiet moment of reflection or joining a bustling festival, each area inside has a purpose that connects humans to the natural and sacred world around them. I encourage you to explore one soon and experience these spaces firsthand."}

{"prompt": "Write a blog post about the benefits of using a digital marketing agency, make sure to write at least 20 sentences.", "response": "# Why Partnering with a Digital Marketing Agency Is Your Business\u2019s Secret Growth Weapon  \n\nImagine you\u2019re the owner of a cozy neighborhood bookstore. You curate the perfect selection of novels, host charming author events, and know every regular by name\u2014but when it comes to getting people to find your shop online, you\u2019re stuck. You\u2019ve tried posting on Instagram here and there, dabbled in Google Ads, and even attempted to learn SEO from a YouTube tutorial, but your online traffic stays stagnant, and your sales aren\u2019t growing as fast as you\u2019d hope. If this sounds familiar, you\u2019re not alone. Millions of small and medium-sized business owners struggle to keep up with the ever-changing world of digital marketing, and that\u2019s where partnering with a digital marketing agency can be a game-changer.  \n\nOne of the most significant benefits of working with an agency is gaining access to a team of specialized experts under one roof. Digital marketing isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all field; it encompasses SEO, social media management, content creation, pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, email marketing, and more. Trying to master all these areas on your own is like asking a chef to also be a plumber, electrician, and carpenter\u2014possible, but not ideal. Agencies have dedicated professionals who focus solely on their niche: an SEO specialist who knows every trick to boost your Google rankings, a social media strategist who understands how to craft posts that resonate with your target audience, and a content writer who can create blog posts and videos that drive engagement. This level of expertise ensures that every aspect of your digital strategy is executed to the highest standard, something that\u2019s nearly impossible to achieve with a single in-house hire or DIY efforts.  \n\nAnother key advantage is cost-effectiveness. Hiring an in-house digital marketing team can be prohibitively expensive for many businesses. You\u2019d need to pay salaries, benefits, training costs, and invest in premium tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or HubSpot\u2014all of which add up quickly. In contrast, partnering with an agency allows you to pay for exactly the services you need, whether that\u2019s a full-scale digital strategy or just help with your social media campaigns. You don\u2019t have to worry about overhead costs or paying for downtime when there\u2019s less work to do. For example, if you\u2019re launching a new product, you can ramp up your PPC and social media efforts through the agency, then scale back once the launch hype dies down\u2014no need to lay off employees or cut hours. This flexibility makes agencies a much more budget-friendly option for businesses of all sizes.  \n\nStaying ahead of the curve is also a major benefit of working with an agency. The digital landscape is constantly evolving: Google updates its search algorithm hundreds of times a year, Instagram introduces new features like Reels or Threads, and consumer preferences shift overnight. For a business owner who\u2019s already juggling a dozen other tasks, keeping up with these changes is nearly impossible. But for digital marketing agencies, staying on top of trends is their job. They attend industry conferences, take advanced training courses, and have access to exclusive resources that help them adapt their strategies in real-time. If Google rolls out a new update that penalizes certain SEO practices, an agency will adjust your website and content immediately to avoid losing rankings. DIY marketers, on the other hand, might not even hear about the update until it\u2019s too late, leading to a drop in traffic and sales.  \n\nScalability is another reason to consider partnering with an agency. As your business grows, your digital marketing needs will change. Maybe you start with a small local audience and want to expand to a national market, or you launch a new product line that requires a targeted advertising campaign. An agency can quickly scale up your efforts to meet these new demands, without the need to hire and train new staff. They already have the resources and expertise to handle larger campaigns, so you can focus on growing your business instead of worrying about how to manage your digital strategy. Conversely, if your business hits a slow period, you can scale back your agency services without the stress of layoffs or restructuring your team.  \n\nA fresh perspective is often overlooked but incredibly valuable. Internal teams can get stuck in a rut, repeating the same strategies because they\u2019re familiar, even if they\u2019re not working. Agencies bring an outside eye to your business, allowing them to spot opportunities you might have missed. For example, they might notice that your target audience is spending more time on TikTok than Facebook, or that your blog posts are ranking for keywords that aren\u2019t actually driving sales. This outside perspective can help you pivot your strategy to focus on the channels and tactics that will have the biggest impact on your bottom line.  \n\nData-driven decision-making is at the core of every successful digital marketing campaign, and agencies excel at this. They use advanced analytics tools to track every metric that matters, from website traffic and click-through rates to conversion rates and customer lifetime value. Instead of guessing what\u2019s working, they use hard data to adjust your campaigns in real-time. If a social media post isn\u2019t getting engagement, they\u2019ll tweak the content or targeting to reach a more relevant audience. If a PPC campaign is driving a lot of clicks but no conversions, they\u2019ll optimize the landing page to improve conversion rates. This level of precision ensures that every dollar you spend on digital marketing is working as hard as possible to grow your business.  \n\nSaving time is perhaps the most immediate benefit of partnering with an agency. As a business owner, your time is your most valuable asset. Spending hours trying to learn SEO, schedule social media posts, or analyze data takes away from the tasks that only you can do\u2014like developing new products, building relationships with customers, or managing your team. By outsourcing your digital marketing to an agency, you can free up hours of your time each week to focus on what you do best. You\u2019ll no longer have to stay up late trying to figure out how to run a Facebook ad or spend weekends updating your blog. Instead, you can trust that your digital strategy is in good hands, allowing you to focus on growing your business and enjoying the fruits of your labor.  \n\nAccess to premium tools is another perk that comes with partnering with an agency. Many of the best digital marketing tools are expensive, with monthly subscriptions that can cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. For example, Ahrefs, a popular SEO tool, costs $99 to $999 per month, depending on the plan. HubSpot, a leading CRM and marketing automation platform, starts at $45 per month for basic plans and goes up to thousands for enterprise-level services. Most small businesses can\u2019t afford to invest in all these tools, but agencies already have subscriptions to the best ones. This means you get access to cutting-edge technology and insights without having to pay for the tools yourself. Your agency will use these tools to conduct keyword research, track your website\u2019s performance, analyze your competitors, and create targeted advertising campaigns\u2014all of which help you get ahead of the competition.  \n\nConsistent brand messaging is crucial for building trust and recognition with your audience. When your social media posts, blog content, email newsletters, and website all have the same tone, voice, and visual identity, it helps customers recognize and remember your brand. Internal teams might struggle to maintain this consistency, especially if multiple people are working on different channels. But agencies have brand guidelines and processes in place to ensure that every piece of content aligns with your brand\u2019s identity. They\u2019ll work with you to define your brand voice, create a style guide, and ensure that every post, ad, and blog post adheres to these guidelines. This consistency helps build trust with your audience, leading to higher customer loyalty and repeat business.  \n\nTo put this into perspective, let\u2019s look at a real-world example. A local bakery in Portland, Oregon, was struggling to increase its online orders. The owner had tried posting photos of their pastries on Instagram and running a few Google Ads, but they weren\u2019t seeing much of a return. After partnering with a digital marketing agency, the team conducted a thorough analysis of the bakery\u2019s target audience and found that most of their customers were young professionals who ordered breakfast on their way to work. The agency created a targeted Instagram Reels campaign showcasing the bakery\u2019s breakfast items, optimized the bakery\u2019s website for local SEO, and launched a Google Ads campaign targeting people searching for \u201cbreakfast delivery near me.\u201d Within six months, the bakery saw a 35% increase in online orders and a 20% increase in foot traffic. This kind of growth wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the agency\u2019s expertise and data-driven strategy.  \n\nIf you\u2019re still on the fence about partnering with a digital marketing agency, consider this: DIY digital marketing can lead to costly mistakes. For example, if you don\u2019t know how to properly optimize your Google Ads campaign, you could waste hundreds or even thousands of dollars on clicks from people who aren\u2019t interested in your product. Or, if you don\u2019t keep up with Google\u2019s algorithm updates, your website could drop in search rankings, leading to a significant loss of traffic. Agencies have the experience and expertise to avoid these mistakes, ensuring that your digital marketing efforts are effective and efficient.  \n\nIn conclusion, partnering with a digital marketing agency is one of the best investments you can make in your business. It gives you access to specialized expertise, saves you time and money, helps you stay ahead of trends, and provides you with a data-driven strategy that drives growth. Whether you\u2019re a small business owner looking to increase local traffic or a larger company wanting to expand your national reach, an agency can help you achieve your goals. So stop trying to do it all yourself and start leveraging the power of a digital marketing agency to take your business to the next level. Your bottom line will thank you."}
{"prompt": "Kindly summarize the text below in XML format. Make sure the summary contains less than 4 sentences.\n\nQuantum entanglement is the phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance. The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "<summary>\n  <content>Quantum entanglement is a quantum mechanical phenomenon where particles\u2019 quantum states are interdependent even across large distances, exhibiting correlated measurements of properties like spin that conflict with classical physics; this behavior sparked the EPR paradox, which Einstein dismissed as \"spooky action at a distance\" for violating his local realism view of causality.</content>\n</summary>"}

It is a specialized branch of physics, falling under the domain of mechanics, that systematically investigates the motion, behavior, and effects of projectiles (including bullets, artillery shells, rockets, sports balls, and more).\n\nBallistics strictly follows core scientific principles: it uses established mathematical models (such as Newton's laws of motion) to predict projectile trajectories, relies on empirical data gathered through controlled experiments, and undergoes rigorous testing and validation of its theories. It is divided into focused subfields that address distinct phases of a projectile's journey:\n1. Internal ballistics: Explores the processes inside a weapon (like propellant ignition and pressure buildup) that initiate the projectile's launch.\n2. External ballistics: Analyzes the projectile's path through the atmosphere, accounting for forces like gravity, air resistance, and wind.\n3. Terminal ballistics: Examines the projectile's behavior upon impact with a target, including penetration, energy transfer, and resulting damage.\n\nAdditionally, ballistics intersects with other scientific disciplines such as materials science (for optimizing projectile and weapon design) and forensic science (for crime scene analysis involving firearms). Its evidence-based, testable nature and practical applications confirm its status as a legitimate scientific field."}

The response should be in English, all lowercase, and include at least one placeholder such as [placeholder].", "response": "research proposal: long-term economic impacts of the liberian civil wars on post-conflict recovery and inclusive growth\n\nabstract\nthis research proposal seeks to investigate the enduring economic impacts of liberia\u2019s two civil wars (1989\u20131996 and 1999\u20132003) on the country\u2019s macroeconomic stability, local livelihood systems, and inclusive growth trajectories. while liberia has made modest progress in post-conflict recovery, persistent disparities in income, access to resources, and institutional capacity suggest that war-induced economic scars remain unaddressed. existing scholarship often prioritizes macroeconomic indicators such as gdp growth or foreign direct investment, but overlooks the nuanced interactions between war-related institutional breakdowns, informal economic adaptation, and marginalized groups\u2019 access to recovery support. this study will use mixed methods to analyze both macroeconomic trends and local-level experiences, with a specific focus on how war disruptions to land tenure have shaped the effectiveness of [community-led land tenure regularization projects] in rural liberia. findings will inform evidence-based policy interventions to mitigate persistent economic inequalities and foster inclusive, resilient growth.\n\n1. introduction\nliberia\u2019s civil wars resulted in an estimated 250,000 deaths, the displacement of over 1 million people, and the near-total collapse of formal economic institutions and critical infrastructure (roads, ports, agricultural extension services). in the two decades since the end of the second war, the country has seen partial recovery: gdp growth averaged 4.5% between 2010 and 2020, and foreign direct investment has increased in sectors like mining and palm oil. however, these gains have not been evenly distributed: 50% of liberians still live below the poverty line, and rural communities\u2014where 60% of the population resides\u2014face persistent challenges in accessing markets, credit, and secure land rights.\n\na key gap in current research is the lack of analysis linking war-induced institutional damage to the performance of local economic initiatives designed to support recovery, such as [community-led land tenure regularization projects]. these projects aim to resolve land disputes rooted in war-time displacement and informal occupation, but their effectiveness is poorly understood, particularly in regions where war destroyed traditional governance structures. this study will address this gap by examining how the civil wars reshaped economic structures at both macro and local levels, and how these changes continue to constrain inclusive growth for marginalized groups.\n\n2. research objectives\nthe study will pursue three core objectives:\n1. to assess the long-term macroeconomic impacts of the liberian civil wars, including changes to gdp structure, infrastructure access, trade patterns, and formal sector employment.\n2. to analyze how war-induced disruptions to land tenure systems and local governance institutions affected the implementation and outcomes of [community-led land tenure regularization projects] and rural livelihoods (e.g., small-scale agriculture, informal cross-border trade).\n3. to identify context-specific policy interventions that can mitigate persistent economic scars, strengthen local institutions, and support inclusive growth for women, youth, and war-affected communities.\n\n3. literature review\nexisting scholarship on civil war economic impacts highlights that conflicts can lead to long-term \"economic scars\" by destroying physical capital, eroding human capital, and weakening institutional capacity (collier, 1999; cervellati et al., 2013). for liberia, studies by the world bank (2018) and un development programme (2020) have documented macroeconomic recovery trends, but few have explored the local-level dynamics of war-induced economic change.\n\nnotably, research on post-conflict land tenure in liberia (doyle, 2015) has focused on formal legal reforms, but has not examined how war-time informal land practices interact with [community-led land tenure regularization projects] to shape livelihood outcomes. this study will build on this work by integrating macroeconomic analysis with qualitative insights from local stakeholders to provide a holistic understanding of war\u2019s enduring economic impacts, particularly for groups excluded from formal recovery processes.\n\n4. methodology\nthis study will use a mixed-methods approach to triangulate quantitative macroeconomic data with qualitative local-level insights:\n- quantitative component: time-series analysis of liberian economic data from 1980 to 2023, including gdp by sector, agricultural productivity, trade volumes, and poverty rates. we will use a difference-in-differences framework to compare liberia\u2019s economic trends to a control group of similar west african countries (e.g., sierra leone, guinea-bissau) that experienced lower-intensity conflict during the same period. this will help isolate the specific impacts of liberia\u2019s civil wars from regional economic trends.\n- qualitative component: semi-structured interviews with 50 stakeholders, including small-scale farmers, informal traders, local government officials, and staff from [community-led land tenure regularization projects] in three war-affected counties (montserrado, lofa, nimba). we will also conduct 10 focus group discussions with women and youth to capture gendered and intergenerational impacts of war on economic opportunities. all interviews will be transcribed and coded using thematic analysis to identify key patterns in war-induced economic disruptions and recovery challenges.\n\nethical considerations: all participants will provide informed consent, and interviews will be conducted in local languages (krio, mano, loma) to ensure accessibility. participants will be compensated for their time, and steps will be taken to avoid re-traumatization by allowing participants to pause or terminate interviews at any point.\n\n5. timeline\nthe project will be completed over 12 months:\n- months 1\u20132: finalize research design, conduct literature review, and secure ethical approval from liberia\u2019s national ethics committee.\n- months 3\u20135: collect and analyze quantitative time-series data; develop interview guides and recruit participants.\n- months 6\u20138: conduct fieldwork for qualitative data collection, including interviews and focus group discussions.\n- months 9\u201310: transcribe and code qualitative data; synthesize quantitative and qualitative findings.\n- months 11: draft research report, share preliminary findings with stakeholders for feedback, and revise.\n- month 12: finalize report, disseminate findings to liberia\u2019s ministry of finance and development planning, local ngos, and [community-led land tenure regularization projects]; submit a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication.\n\n6. budget\ntotal estimated budget: $32,000\n- fieldwork expenses (transport, accommodation, participant compensation): $16,000\n- data access and analysis tools (world bank open data, qualitative coding software): $2,500\n- research assistant salaries (two part-time local assistants for fieldwork and data coding): $8,000\n- dissemination costs (workshops, report printing, online access): $3,500\n- contingency fund (for unforeseen fieldwork challenges): $2,000\n\n7. expected outcomes\nthis study will produce three key outputs:\n1. a comprehensive research report that links macroeconomic trends to local-level economic experiences, with specific insights into the performance of [community-led land tenure regularization projects] in war-affected areas.\n2. policy briefings tailored to liberian government officials and ngos, outlining actionable interventions to strengthen inclusive recovery, such as targeted support for small-scale agriculture and improved coordination between formal land reforms and local initiatives.\n3. a peer-reviewed journal article that contributes to global scholarship on civil war economic impacts, with a focus on marginalized groups and informal economic systems.\n\n8. conclusion\nliberia\u2019s civil wars left deep and enduring scars on its economy, and current recovery efforts have not fully addressed the needs of marginalized communities. this research will fill critical gaps in understanding how war-induced institutional disruptions continue to shape economic outcomes, with a specific focus on [community-led land tenure regularization projects] as a key recovery tool. by integrating macro and local-level analysis, this study will provide evidence-based insights to support more inclusive, resilient economic growth in liberia.\n\nreferences (placeholder)\ncollier, p.

{"prompt": "Write a brief about limping in ASEAN countries. Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<title of the brief>>. Make sure the letter m appears at least 5 times.", "response": "<<Limping Mobility: Addressing Marginalized Movement Gaps Across ASEAN>>\n\nLimping, whether as a physical impairment or a metaphor for stunted access to movement, touches millions of lives across ASEAN\u2019s 10 member states. For marginalized communities\u2014including people with disabilities, rural dwellers, and low-income migrants\u2014limping is not just a personal challenge but a systemic barrier that locks them out of mainstream opportunities.\n\nIn many remote regions, physical limping caused by congenital conditions, injuries, or neglected diseases like polio remains unaddressed due to limited medical infrastructure. In Myanmar\u2019s mountainous Chin State, hundreds of children with limping from clubfoot or childhood infections lack access to specialized clinics, as most healthcare facilities are concentrated in major cities like Yangon. Similarly, in parts of Malaysia, migrant workers with work-related injuries that result in limping often face obstacles to affordable treatment, excluded from public health schemes and unable to pay for private care.\n\nMetaphorically, limping mobility plagues critical sectors across the region. Indonesia\u2019s sprawling archipelago relies on a limping network of ferries and rural roads, where outdated vessels and potholed paths make it impossible for farmers to transport crops to urban markets, or for students to reach distant schools. This limping infrastructure also hinders emergency responses: during the 2023 floods in Thailand, many villages were cut off for days because damaged bridges and washed-out roads delayed aid deliveries.\n\nASEAN has taken modest steps to tackle these gaps, such as the ASEAN Disability Strategic Plan 2021\u20132030, which aims to improve accessibility for people with limping and other mobility impairments. However, implementation remains inconsistent, with many member states lacking the funding or political will to mainstream inclusive policies. For example, while Singapore has made strides in building wheelchair-accessible public transport, neighboring Laos still has few paved roads that accommodate people with limping or other mobility needs.\n\nTo overcome limping mobility in ASEAN, member states must prioritize collaborative action: sharing medical expertise to treat physical limping in remote areas, investing in resilient infrastructure to fix metaphorical gaps, and reforming legal frameworks to protect vulnerable migrants. Only then can millions of people across the region move beyond the limitations of limping and fully participate in ASEAN\u2019s growing economic and social landscape."}

Paragraph 1 must start with the word booster.", "response": "Booster seat for your set theory brain, let\u2019s break down these two sets with some snappy math notation and zero stuffy jargon. First up, Russell\u2019s infamous paradox set: let\u2019s denote it as \\( R = \\{ x \\mid x \\text{ is a set and } x \\notin x \\} \\). In plain terms, this is the collection of every set that doesn\u2019t contain itself as a member. Think of the set of all dogs\u2014since that set isn\u2019t a dog, it\u2019s in R. The set of even numbers? Not an even number, so it\u2019s also in R. But here\u2019s the twist: if we ask whether R is in itself, we hit a contradiction. If \\( R \\in R \\), then by R\u2019s definition \\( R \\notin R \\), and if \\( R \\notin R \\), then it satisfies the condition to be in R (\\( R \\in R \\))\u2014total logical loop! Now, the set of all sets, let\u2019s call it \\( U = \\{ x \\mid x \\text{ is a set} \\} \\), is exactly what it sounds like: every possible set you can imagine is a member of U. That includes tiny sets like {1}, big sets like the real numbers, and even U itself (since U is a set, it has to contain itself).\n\n\nThe core differences between \\( R \\) and \\( U \\) boil down to their logical consistency and scope, and it\u2019s fun to spot how they cause chaos in different ways. For starters, \\( R \\) is a \"conditional\" set\u2014it only includes sets that fail the self-membership test, while \\( U \\) is an \"unconditional\" set that claims to include every set, full stop. Mathematically, \\( U \\) would satisfy \\( U \\in U \\) (since it\u2019s a set, it has to be its own member), but \\( R \\) can\u2019t have a consistent membership status for itself\u2014there\u2019s no way to say \\( R \\in R \\) or \\( R \\notin R \\) without breaking its own definition. Another big gap: in standard Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF) set theory, we explicitly ban both, but for different reasons. We nix \\( U \\) because the axiom of separation (which lets us build sets from existing ones) would let us carve out \\( R \\) from \\( U \\), creating the paradox. But \\( R \\) is problematic on its own\u2014even without \\( U \\), its definition leads to a direct logical contradiction that can\u2019t be fixed by tweaking other axioms. So while both are troublemakers, \\( R \\) is a self-sabotaging contradiction machine, and \\( U \\) is an overambitious collection that accidentally lets contradictions sneak in."}

So we turned  \nthe church basement into a fiesta: brought chips from the corner store,  \nblared Selena on a boombox, and Father Joe let us use  \nthe \u201cadult only\u201d ping-pong table even though his boss frowned.  \nWe sold friendship bracelets made from yarn we stole from the altar cloths  \nand kept the youth group going for another three years.  \n\nBy 2019, the diocese was slashing small parishes left and right.  \nThey cut our maintenance fund, said the stained glass was \u201cnon-essential.\u201d  \nAbuela Rosa\u2014now silver-haired, still stubborn\u2014organized another fiesta:  \ncar washes in the parking lot, tamales out of her pickup truck,  \nkids selling lemonade that was mostly sugar and hope.  \nWe fixed the cracked window above the crucifix, the one that let rain in  \non Good Friday, and Father Mike said, \u201cThis is the church the bishop never sees.\u201d  \n\nNow this. Merging parishes. Father Mike calls it \u201cstreamlining,\u201d  \nbut I saw him wiping the rectory\u2019s kitchen counters last week,  \nhis hands shaking like he was saying goodbye to a friend.  \n\nThis year\u2019s fiesta was quieter, but we still showed up.  \nNo bounce house, no mariachi\u2014just folding tables in the parking lot,  \nenchiladas instead of catered tacos, Father Mike playing guitar  \neven though his arthritis ached. The kids from St. Jude\u2019s joined ours  \nto whack a pi\u00f1ata shaped like a diocese budget report (we may have gone too far).  \nWe didn\u2019t raise enough to keep the rectory open,  \nbut we raised enough to buy new hymnals\u2014Spanish and English side by side\u2014  \nfor both parishes.  \n\nReductions come and go, like the priest who left for a bigger church,  \nlike the winter they cut the heat and we wore coats to mass.  \nThey cut budgets, merge parishes, tell us to shrink, to be \u201cefficient.\u201d  \nBut the fiesta? It doesn\u2019t get reduced. It just changes shape\u2014  \nsometimes a tamale sale, sometimes a ping-pong tournament,  \nsometimes just us sitting in the parking lot, singing off-key,  \nreminding each other that the church isn\u2019t the line items in a diocese spreadsheet.  \nIt\u2019s the way we show up, even when they tell us to stay home.  \nIt\u2019s the fiesta that outlasts every cut, every reduction, every bishop  \nwho ever forgot that the church isn\u2019t a business. It\u2019s us."}

CLEARLY states the book\u2019s title, author, and a specific thesis (e.g., \"The House in the Cerulean Sea uses quirky characters to argue that kindness is a form of rebellion\"). MUST avoid generic lines like \"I really liked this book.\" | Has a basic hook (e.g., \"This book changed how I think about friendship\") and includes title/author plus a simple thesis. | Weak hook (e.g., \"I read this book for class\") and missing either the thesis or key identifying info (title/author). | No hook; no clear thesis or mention of the book\u2019s title/author. | 15 |\n| **CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THEME & CHARACTERS** | Dives into 2+ key themes (e.g., identity, justice, belonging) and analyzes how main characters\u2019 choices or growth reflect these themes.

MUST cite page numbers if you\u2019re using a physical book or e-book with page markers. | Most opinions have text support; some explanations link evidence to the claim, but others are missing. | Few opinions are backed by text evidence; little to no explanation of how the evidence connects to your point. | No text evidence included; all claims are unsubstantiated personal opinions. | 25 |\n| **ORIGINAL TEEN VOICE & AUDIENCE AWARENESS** | Writes in an authentic, relatable teen voice\u2014casual but not unpolished. CLEARLY addresses what other teens would CARE ABOUT (e.g., \"If you\u2019re tired of predictable romance, this book\u2019s enemies-to-lovers twist feels fresh and real\"). AVOIDS overly formal jargon that makes the review unapproachable. | Maintains a consistent voice; mentions who might enjoy the book but lacks specific teen-focused details. | Inconsistent voice (switches between formal and slangy); does not connect the book to teen readers\u2019 interests. | Stiff, formal tone; no consideration of who should read the book. | 15 |\n| **STRONG CONCLUSION & RECOMMENDATION** | Restates the thesis in a fresh way (no word-for-word repetition of the intro) and wraps up analysis with a new insight. CLEARLY gives a rating (e.g., 4.5/5 stars) and explains why. MUST end with a memorable takeaway (e.g., \"This book taught me that courage isn\u2019t the absence of fear\u2014it\u2019s acting anyway\"). | Restates the thesis; gives a rating with a basic explanation (e.g., \"I give it 4 stars because the plot was exciting\"). | Weak conclusion that repeats the intro without new insight; no clear rating or recommendation. | No conclusion; no rating or recommendation for other readers. | 15 |\n\n**Final Notes for Teens**:  \n- DON\u2019T be afraid to be honest\u2014if you hated a book, explain why (but always be respectful of the author\u2019s work).  \n- REMEMBER: The goal is to help other teens decide if this book is worth their time, so be specific about what worked (and what didn\u2019t) for you."}

But within 10 minutes, they\u2019re bickering so loud a nearby brisket food truck vendor yells over: \u201cY\u2019all gonna order ribs or argue over who gets to hold the protest sign? This ain\u2019t a city council meeting!\u201d\n\nSECTION 2: Determined to prove their point, the anarchists declare all lines, schedules, and unwritten rules null and void. They march to a legendary Tulsa BBQ joint, skip the 45-minute line, and start grabbing trays of smoked sausage. That\u2019s when Mabel, an 82-year-old grandma in a sequined cowboy hat who\u2019s been waiting since 10 a.m., taps the lead anarchist on the shoulder. \u201cHoney,\u201d she says, adjusting her bedazzled sunglasses, \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of chaos you\u2019re peddling, but in Tulsa, we respect the BBQ line. Now get back there before I tell my grandson\u2014he\u2019s a cop, but more importantly, he\u2019s got a smoker that could melt your protest signs.\u201d The anarchists scramble to the end of the line without a word.\n\nSECTION 3: By sunset, the anarchists have abandoned their rally. Instead, they\u2019re sitting on the curb next to the Golden Driller, passing around a plate of Mabel\u2019s leftover ribs, and arguing about who gets to keep the sequined cowboy hat she gave them.

{"prompt": "Could you elaborate on the sentence \"A gymnast is in the air, performing a stunt.\"? Please highlight at least 6 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *highlighted section*. Please write at least 300 words.", "response": "The sentence \u201cA gymnast is in the air, performing a stunt\u201d captures a fleeting, high-stakes moment that is the culmination of years of training, precise physics, and unshakable mental focus. To fully unpack it, we must look beyond the surface to the layers of effort, skill, and emotion contained in that split second.\n\n*The Physics of Airborne Suspension*  \nThis isn\u2019t just random flight\u2014it\u2019s a masterclass in projectile motion. The gymnast\u2019s airtime is the payoff of an explosive takeoff: for a floor exercise stunt, they might have sprinted 10\u201315 feet, converting horizontal momentum into vertical lift via a powerful push-off from their legs, often using a round-off or back handspring to amplify upward force. At the peak of their jump, gravity begins to pull them back down, but in that brief window (usually 0.5\u20131.5 seconds, depending on the stunt), they have full control over their body\u2019s rotation and alignment. Their center of gravity must stay perfectly balanced; even a slight shift can throw off the entire sequence, leading to a wobbly landing or a fall.\n\n*The Stunt\u2019s Technical Blueprint*  \nWhat constitutes the \u201cstunt\u201d varies widely, but let\u2019s imagine a double back somersault with a 1.5 twist\u2014a common high-difficulty element in elite competition. Every muscle is engaged in a precise sequence: as they leave the mat, they tuck their chin to initiate the backflip, contract their core to pull their knees toward their chest (speeding up rotation), then extend their arms and legs at just the right moment to slow the spin and prepare for landing. Each movement is calibrated to the millisecond; tuck too long, and they\u2019ll overrotate; extend too early, and they\u2019ll underrotate. Judges score not just the completion of the stunt but the form: pointed toes, straight legs, tight core, and controlled rotation are all critical to earning top marks.\n\n*The Pre-Air Preparation That Unfolds Invisible to Viewers*  \nThe split second in the air is the tip of the iceberg. Months before this moment, the gymnast has repeated the stunt thousands of times\u2014first on a trampoline to build air awareness, then on a foam pit to reduce injury risk, then gradually on a regulation mat. In the minutes before their routine, they\u2019ll have done dynamic stretches to warm up their hamstrings, quads, and core, and mentally walked through the sequence three or four times, visualizing every takeoff, rotation, and landing. Even the run-up is rehearsed: they mark their starting position with a piece of tape, ensuring each step is exactly the same length to generate the perfect amount of momentum.\n\n*Sensory and Kinesthetic Awareness Mid-Flight*  \nFor the gymnast, mid-air is a hyper-aware state. Their inner ear works overtime to maintain spatial orientation, sending constant signals to their brain about their rotation and position relative to the mat. They don\u2019t just \u201cfeel\u201d their body\u2014they sense every muscle fiber: the burn in their core as they tuck, the stretch in their shoulders as they extend their arms, the pressure of their hands against their knees during the somersault. Some gymnasts describe this as a \u201cflow state,\u201d where time seems to slow down, allowing them to make tiny adjustments if needed\u2014like shifting their weight slightly to correct an overrotation.\n\n*Mental Fortitude: Quieting the Noise in Zero Gravity*  \nIn the air, there\u2019s no room for doubt. The gymnast must block out the roar of the crowd, the pressure of the judges\u2019 eyes, and any fear of failure. Elite gymnasts often use a technique called \u201cexternal focus,\u201d where they concentrate on the outcome (landing softly, pointing their toes) rather than the mechanics of the movement, letting muscle memory take over. This is crucial because active thinking mid-flight can disrupt the automatic sequence of movements they\u2019ve trained for years. They might repeat a single word or phrase in their head\u2014\u201ctight,\u201d \u201cextend,\u201d \u201cland\u201d\u2014to stay grounded in the moment.\n\n*The Audience\u2019s Collective Breath: A Synchronized Emotional Response*  \nTo the spectators in the arena, this moment is a study in collective tension. The crowd, which was cheering moments earlier, falls silent as the gymnast launches into the air. Everyone\u2019s eyes are locked on their body, tracking every rotation. There\u2019s a shared sense of anticipation: will they stick the landing? Did they complete the full twist? This hush is broken only when the gymnast\u2019s feet hit the mat\u2014if it\u2019s a perfect landing, the crowd erupts into cheers; if not, there\u2019s a collective gasp followed by supportive applause. For many viewers, this moment is the most thrilling part of the routine, as they vicariously experience the gymnast\u2019s risk and skill.\n\n*Post-Stunt Resolution: The Split Second Between Air and Mat*  \nThe stunt doesn\u2019t end when the gymnast leaves the air\u2014it ends when they land. As they descend, they bend their knees slightly to absorb the impact, keeping their core tight to maintain balance.

{"prompt": "Explain to me how to ride a bike like I am a kid. Also, do not include the keywords \"slow\", \"like\" and \"kid\".", "response": "First, pick a flat, open place where there are no cars, sharp sticks, or big bumps. Find a bike that fits you perfectly\u2014when you sit on the seat, your feet should reach the ground easily so you can steady yourself whenever you need to.\n\nGrab the handlebars with both hands. Keep your grip firm but not so tight that your fingers get tired. Put one foot on the lower pedal, and leave the other foot on the ground to push off.\n\nNow, give a strong push with your ground foot. As you glide forward, swing that foot up to the other pedal. Start moving your legs in smooth circles\u2014each time your foot goes down, push it forward a little too to keep the bike rolling steadily.\n\nHere\u2019s a super important trick: don\u2019t look at your feet! Keep your eyes on the path ahead, on the spot where you want to go. Your body will follow where your eyes focus, so if you stare at your shoes, you might start to wobble. Keep your head up and your gaze forward.\n\nIf you feel wobbly, don\u2019t panic! Take a deep breath, keep your body straight, and keep moving your legs in those smooth circles. Small, gentle turns of the handlebars will help you stay on track.\n\nTo stop, if your bike has brakes, press the brake lever with your fingers gently until you come to a stop. If there are no brakes, ease up on the pedals, then put one foot on the ground to hold yourself steady while the bike stops rolling.\n\nAt first, ask a grown-up to hold the back of your seat while you practice. They can let go slowly once you\u2019re feeling confident. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be rolling all over the place, feeling the wind in your hair and grinning from ear to ear!"}

The letter should be in Markdown and have a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<A Letter from the Lord Chamberlain to the Sheriff of Kent, Bearing the King\u2019s Sacred Mandates>>\n\nRight Trusty and Well-beloved Sheriff of Kent,\n\nVerily, I write this with the weight of the King\u2019s own hand upon my pen\u2014commands that flow from the very heart of our sovereign, whose wisdom is as the North Star, guiding this realm through tempests both seen and unforeseen. Prithee, lend thine ear and mark each word, for to neglect these edicts is to turn thy back on the crown that feeds thee, the God that shields thee, and the people who look to thee as their shield.\n\n**First, Thou Shalt Guard the Harvest with Thy Life\u2019s Breath**  \nThe fields of Kent are the breast of our kingdom, whose golden grain gives sustenance to the court and the cottage alike. Doth any man dare to steal from the widow\u2019s stack, or foment strife between neighbor and neighbor over furrows and fences? Thou shalt post watchmen at every crossroad, and bind those who doth stir discord in irons until they hath made amends. Verily, a harvest blighted by strife is a realm starved of hope\u2014so let thy sword be swift to defend the reaper\u2019s toil.\n\n**Second, Thou Shalt Collect the Sacred Dues with Justice and Mercy**  \nThe King doth command that each villager give one tenth of their grain to the parish church, that the poor may be fed and the altars kept bright; and another tenth to the crown, that our castles may be fortified, our soldiers clad in steel, and our shores guarded from the raiders of the North. Prithee, be not harsh to the farmer whose crop hath failed by drought or flood\u2014for mercy is a virtue that the King himself doth prize above gold. But to those who doth hide their stores and feign poverty, let their punishment be swift: a fine of three times the tithe, or a month in the stocks, that others may take warning.\n\n**Third, Thou Shalt Open Thy Halls and Thy Villages to Travelers**  \nPilgrims bound for Canterbury, messengers bearing tidings from the court, or wayfarers lost in the mist\u2014all shall find shelter in thy shire. Let no innkeeper turn away a man for lack of coin, if he be honest and weary; let no serf bar the door to a stranger who seeks a cup of water. Hospitality is the badge of a loyal subject, and the King doth say that he who turns away a traveler turns away the face of God.\n\n**Fourth, Thou Shalt Root Out the Poachers Who Defile the King\u2019s Forests**  \nThe deer of our woods are the King\u2019s own, and the boars that roam the thickets are his to give or to take. Those who doth slay them without leave are thieves, not hunters\u2014they steal from the crown\u2019s larder and mock the King\u2019s authority. Thou shalt set traps for these miscreants, and bring them before the King\u2019s justices. Let their hands be branded with the letter \u201cP\u201d that all may know their shame, and let their goods be seized to fill the poor\u2019s coffers.\n\n**Fifth, Thou Shalt Prepare for the King\u2019s Progress Through Thy Shire**  \nIn three moons\u2019 time, our sovereign shall ride from London to Dover, to see the faces of his people and to bless the shores that guard our realm. Thou shalt mend the roads that they be free of ruts and stones; thou shalt bid the innkeepers to clean their halls and brew their best ale; thou shalt gather a company of the shire\u2019s most valiant men to ride with him, and a chorus of maidens to sing his praises. Let Kent shine like a jewel in the King\u2019s crown, that he may speak of thy loyalty in every court in Christendom.\n\nPrithee, forget not these commands. The King\u2019s eye is upon thee, and his wrath is as a storm that doth lay waste to the proud. But if thou dost fulfill thy duty with diligence and grace, thou shalt be rewarded with his favor, and thy name shall be spoken with honor in the halls of Westminster.\n\nI send thee this with the King\u2019s great seal attached\u2014look upon it, and remember that thou art but a servant of the realm, and the realm is but a servant of God.\n\nFare thee well, and may thy hand be steady, thy heart be true, and thy sword be swift in the King\u2019s service.\n\nThy Loyal Servant,  \nLord Chamberlain of the Royal Household  \nWestminster Palace, the 15th Day of August, in the Tenth Year of Our King\u2019s Reign"}

Use the word para at least once.", "response": "# Letter to the Editor Template: Local Environmental Crisis Action\n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Street Address]  \n[Your City, State, ZIP Code]  \n[Your Email Address]  \n[Your Phone Number]  \n[Date]  \n\n[Editor\u2019s Full Name]  \n[Newspaper Name]  \n[Newspaper Street Address]  \n[Newspaper City, State, ZIP Code]  \n\nSubject: Urgent Action Needed to Halt Proposed Industrial Facility and Protect Our Watershed from Pollution & Climate Harm  \n\nDear [Editor\u2019s Name],  \n\nI am writing to amplify the growing outcry among local residents over the proposed [Industrial Facility Name] near the [Local River/Watershed Name], as referenced in your October 12 article, \u201cRiverfront Development Plan Advances Amid Community Pushback.\u201d While your piece noted job creation claims, it failed to center the catastrophic long-term impacts this facility would have on our environment, public health, and efforts to combat climate change\u2014impacts that demand immediate, collective action.  \n\nAs highlighted in para 3 of that article, the facility\u2019s projected annual carbon emissions would exceed 60,000 tons, equivalent to adding 13,000 gas-powered cars to our roads each year. In a region already grappling with record heatwaves, flash flooding, and a 25% rise in pediatric asthma cases linked to poor air quality, this is not just an environmental concern\u2014it\u2019s a matter of survival. Our [Local River/Watershed Name] supplies 40% of our city\u2019s drinking water, and the facility\u2019s unfiltered wastewater discharge risks leaching toxic chemicals into the river, endangering aquatic life and the families who rely on this source for safe drinking water.  \n\nA para-volunteer coalition of local environmental groups, parents, and small business owners has already collected over 1,200 signatures demanding a full, independent environmental impact statement (EIS) that includes a comprehensive climate risk assessment. But we need your newspaper\u2019s voice to cut through the noise of corporate lobbying and hold our elected officials accountable. The facility\u2019s backers argue it will bring 200 jobs, but those gains are trivial compared to the long-term costs: skyrocketing healthcare bills from pollution-related illnesses, millions in climate adaptation costs for future flooding, and the irreversible loss of our region\u2019s most vital natural resource.  \n\nWe don\u2019t have to choose between jobs and a healthy planet. Instead of greenlighting a polluting industrial site, we could repurpose the riverfront land for a community solar farm, creating sustainable jobs and reducing our city\u2019s carbon footprint by 15% within five years. This is a solution that benefits everyone\u2014workers, families, and future generations.  \n\nI urge you to dedicate more coverage to this critical issue, feature stories from residents affected by past pollution, and editorialize in support of halting the facility\u2019s approval until a thorough, climate-focused EIS is completed. I also encourage your readers to join our coalition\u2019s town hall on [Date] at [Location] and sign our petition online at [Petition Link].  \n\nOur environment, our health, and our future depend on it.  \n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Full Name]  \n[Optional: Affiliation, e.g., \u201cMember of [Local Environmental Group Name]\u201d]"}
{"prompt": "Write a long and funny email to your friend about the ingredients of a good life that contains at least 20 sentences.", "response": "**Subject: URGENT: Confidential Recipe for Not Sucking at Life (Stolen from My Cat\u2019s Napping Routine)**  \n\nHey Mia,  \n\nI hope this email finds you well, and by \u201cwell\u201d I mean you haven\u2019t accidentally microwaved your phone again (we talked about this\u2014popcorn is for the bowl, not the pocket). I was sitting on my couch last night, staring at the stain that\u2019s either a cloud or a very confused potato, when I had a revelation: life isn\u2019t about having a perfect credit score or a closet full of matching socks. It\u2019s about having a very specific set of ingredients that turn the \u201cmeh\u201d days into \u201cwait, that was actually great\u201d days. And since you\u2019re my partner in crime for all things chaotic, I figured I\u2019d share the top-secret recipe I\u2019ve been perfecting (with zero input from a professional, just my cat who judges me for eating cereal for dinner three nights in a row).  \n\nFirst ingredient: A go-to crisis snack that leaves your fingers permanently stained. Mine are those neon orange cheese puffs from the gas station down the street\u2014the ones that taste like regret and artificial cheese, but in the best way. Last week, when my boss dumped a 50-page report on me at 4:59pm, I snuck a bag into the bathroom and ate them while sitting on the closed toilet. My coworker knocked and asked if I was okay, and I said, \u201cJust having a cheese-fueled existential crisis\u2014carry on.\u201d She now leaves a bag on my desk every Monday. Worth it.  \n\nSecond ingredient: A \u201cno questions asked\u201d person. Spoiler: That\u2019s you. Remember when I called you at 3am last month, sobbing because I thought my spider plant was dying? You showed up with a watering can and a pack of gummy bears, and we spent 20 minutes debating whether the yellow leaves meant it was sad or just dramatic. Turns out it was just thirsty, but you didn\u2019t make fun of me until the next morning (and even then, you bought me coffee to apologize). That\u2019s the kind of person you need in your life\u2014someone who will help you save a plant at 3am instead of telling you to get a grip.  \n\nThird ingredient: A hobby that serves absolutely no practical purpose whatsoever. I\u2019ve been trying to learn to yodel. Not because I want to perform at a Swiss alpine festival, but because I saw a TikTok of a guy yodeling to his goldfish and thought, \u201cI could do that (badly).\u201d Last night, I was practicing my \u201cyodel cry\u201d and my neighbor knocked on the door, holding a baseball bat. She asked if I was being attacked by a seagull. I invited her in to watch me yodel, and now she\u2019s my yodeling buddy. We practice every Wednesday, and her cat hates us. It\u2019s perfect.  \n\nFourth ingredient: The ability to laugh at your own catastrophic mistakes. Two weeks ago, I tripped over a curb in front of the cute barista at the corner caf\u00e9. I went flying, landed face-first in a puddle, and my phone skittered across the sidewalk. Instead of panicking, I looked up at him and said, \u201cJust practicing my marathon face-plant\u2014you think I qualify for the Olympics?\u201d He laughed so hard he spilled his own coffee, and now he gives me a free latte every time I come in. Moral of the story: If you can turn a face-plant into a joke, you can get free coffee. Also, my knee still has a bruise that looks like a map of Texas.  \n\nFifth ingredient: A safe space that\u2019s not fancy. For me, it\u2019s my couch with the potato/cloud stain. It\u2019s lumpy, the armrest is held together with duct tape, and it smells like old popcorn and cat hair. But it\u2019s where we spent three straight days watching that terrible reality show about people who marry strangers, and you cried when one couple got divorced (even though we both knew it was going to happen). It\u2019s where we ate that salt-instead-of-sugar cake we baked last year, and you said, \u201cThis tastes like regret, but I\u2019m still going to finish it.\u201d That couch has seen more of my messy, unfiltered self than anyone else (except you, obviously).  \n\nSixth ingredient: A tiny, daily ritual that makes you feel human. Mine is singing off-key to Britney Spears\u2019 \u201cOops!\u2026 I Did It Again\u201d while I brush my teeth. I don\u2019t care if my neighbor can hear me (she already knows I\u2019m a yodeling maniac). It\u2019s the first thing I do every morning, and it sets the tone for the day\u2014even if I have to go to a meeting where my boss talks about \u201csynergy\u201d for an hour. Yours is feeding that stray cat outside your apartment who judges you for eating cereal for dinner. I\u2019ve seen him stare at you like you\u2019re a disappointment, and you just wave and say, \u201cMind your own business, Mr. Whiskers.\u201d It\u2019s beautiful.  \n\nSeventh ingredient: The courage to say \u201cno\u201d to things that drain you. Last weekend, my boss asked me to come in and work on a project. Normally, I would have said yes, even though I had plans to go to the dog park. But then I thought about my yodeling practice and my cheese puffs, and I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I have a very important engagement with a golden retriever who owes me a lick.\u201d He stared at me for a second, then said, \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d I went to the dog park, got licked by three golden retrievers, and ate a hot dog. It was the best weekend I\u2019ve had in months.  \n\nEighth ingredient: A memory that makes you snort-laugh out loud no matter what. For me, it\u2019s the time we tried to go camping and forgot the tent. We ended up sleeping in your car, and a raccoon stole our bag of chips. You chased it through the woods, yelling, \u201cGIVE ME MY DORITOS BACK,\u201d and I was laughing so hard I peed my pants a little. We still talk about that raccoon like it\u2019s our arch-nemesis, and every time we see a chip bag, we say, \u201cFor the love of all that\u2019s holy, don\u2019t let the raccoon get it.\u201d  \n\nI could go on\u2014like the importance of having a song that makes you dance like no one\u2019s watching (mine is \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d by Beyonc\u00e9, and I once danced to it in the grocery store aisle while buying toilet paper), or the joy of finding a $5 bill in an old jacket pocket (it feels like winning the lottery, even if it\u2019s just enough for a coffee and a donut). I could talk about the stray cat outside my apartment who now lets me pet her (as long as I bring her tuna), or the way my barista writes \u201cFace-plant Queen\u201d on my latte cups now.  \n\nBut the point is, the good life isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about the messy, silly, unplanned moments that make you think, \u201cWow, I\u2019m really lucky to be here.\u201d It\u2019s about having someone who will laugh with you when you yodel like a seagull, who will help you save a dying plant at 3am, who will eat a regret cake with you and not judge you for it.  \n\nAnd since you\u2019re the main ingredient in my good life, I think we need to test this recipe immediately. I\u2019ve got a bag of cheese puffs, a bottle of wine, and that terrible reality show queued up on my couch. Bring your gummy bears and your yodeling voice. We\u2019re going to have a night that\u2019s so messy, so silly, and so us that we\u2019ll be laughing about it for years.  \n\nP.S. Don\u2019t forget to bring the photo of us with the raccoon (the one where you\u2019re holding a stick and I\u2019m hiding behind a tree). I want to tape it to my couch next to the potato/cloud stain.  \n\nP.P.S. If your neighbor asks, we\u2019re not yodeling. We\u2019re practicing emergency seagull impressions.  \n\nCan\u2019t wait to see you,  \nYour Yodeling Partner in Crime (and Face-plant Queen)  \nLila"}

{"prompt": "How are you doing today? Could you write me exactly 4 paragraphs each separated by two new lines? Please start the first paragraph with the word \"firms\".", "response": "Firms across every industry are navigating a delicate balance between operational efficiency and employee well-being as post-pandemic norms continue to solidify. Many have moved beyond temporary remote work policies to implement hybrid models that offer flexibility while preserving in-person collaboration for critical projects. This shift has forced leaders to reevaluate office spaces, investing in collaborative hubs rather than individual cubicles, and adopt digital tools that keep distributed teams connected. Additionally, customers now prioritize transparency and sustainability, pushing firms to integrate eco-friendly practices into their supply chains and communicate their values more openly to build long-term trust.\n\n\nSmaller firms, in particular, face unique challenges in keeping up with these industry-wide changes. Unlike their larger counterparts, they often lack the budget for sophisticated digital infrastructure or dedicated sustainability teams, making it harder to compete on the same level. However, many small firms have turned this limitation into an advantage by leaning into their niche expertise and personalized customer service. For example, local boutique retailers have built loyal communities by hosting in-store events and offering custom products that big-box stores can\u2019t replicate, fostering a sense of connection that resonates deeply with consumers.\n\n\nGlobal firms, on the other hand, grapple with the complexity of aligning their practices across diverse regulatory environments. What\u2019s considered a sustainable practice in one country might not meet the standards of another, and labor laws vary widely, creating hurdles for consistent employee policies. To address this, many multinational companies are adopting a \u201cglocal\u201d approach\u2014implementing core global guidelines while allowing regional teams to adapt them to local needs. This strategy not only ensures compliance but also empowers local employees to take ownership of initiatives, leading to more effective and culturally relevant outcomes.\n\n\nLooking ahead, the success of any firm will likely depend on its ability to remain agile and empathetic. As technology continues to evolve, firms that invest in upskilling their employees to work alongside AI and automation will be better positioned to thrive. Moreover, prioritizing mental health and work-life balance will no longer be a perk but a necessity to attract and retain top talent. In an era where consumers and employees alike demand more from the companies they engage with, firms that combine innovation with integrity will stand out as leaders in their respective fields."}

{"prompt": "What are the common signs and symptoms of abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer? Please answer in lower case letters. The answer should be 600+ words long and be wrapped with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"abdominal and pelvic dissemination is a hallmark of advanced ovarian cancer, as the disease often spreads early through the peritoneal cavity\u2014the thin membrane lining the abdomen and pelvis that covers most internal organs. this spread leads to a wide range of signs and symptoms, many of which are initially vague and easily mistaken for common gastrointestinal or gynecological conditions, contributing to the disease\u2019s reputation as a \u201csilent killer.\u201d however, as dissemination progresses, symptoms become more pronounced and specific, reflecting tumor invasion, fluid accumulation, and disruption of adjacent organ function.\n\none of the most prevalent and recognizable signs is ascites, a buildup of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. this occurs when cancer cells implant on the peritoneal surface, triggering inflammation and increasing fluid production while blocking lymphatic vessels that normally drain excess fluid. patients often report persistent bloating, which may start as mild and intermittent but gradually becomes constant and severe. as ascites worsens, the abdomen becomes distended, leading to tightness in clothing around the waist, visible swelling, and even a \u201cprotuberant\u201d belly that can be mistaken for weight gain or pregnancy in premenopausal people. some patients may experience a sensation of fullness or pressure in the abdomen, and in severe cases, the fluid can press on the diaphragm, causing shortness of breath or difficulty lying flat. ascites can also lead to unintended weight gain, though this may be offset by weight loss from reduced appetite in other cases.\n\npelvic symptoms are another key indicator of dissemination. persistent pelvic pressure or dull, aching pain is common, resulting from tumor growth that invades or compresses pelvic organs such as the uterus, fallopian tubes, bladder, or rectum. this pain may be constant or intermittent, and it can worsen with physical activity or prolonged standing. deep pelvic pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) is also a frequent complaint, as tumor involvement of the pelvic floor, vaginal wall, or adjacent connective tissues can cause discomfort or sharp pain during penetration. in some cases, patients may experience pain during bowel movements or urination if the tumor is pressing on or invading these structures.\n\ngastrointestinal symptoms are among the earliest and most often dismissed signs of ovarian cancer dissemination, as they mimic common conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (gerd). early on, patients may report vague indigestion, bloating, or a feeling of fullness after eating only small amounts of food (early satiety)\u2014a symptom that occurs because tumor masses or ascites compress the stomach, reducing its capacity. as dissemination progresses, these symptoms escalate: nausea and vomiting may develop if tumor masses or adhesions block the intestines, leading to partial or complete bowel obstruction. constipation is a frequent issue, caused by tumor invasion of the rectum, compression of the colon, or the effects of pain medications, while diarrhea may occur less commonly due to inflammation of the intestinal lining. persistent changes in bowel habits, such as straining to pass stools, narrow stools, or a feeling of incomplete bowel emptying, are important red flags that should not be ignored. over time, loss of appetite due to abdominal pressure or inflammation can lead to significant unintended weight loss, though this may be masked by weight gain from ascites in some patients.\n\nurinary symptoms often arise when disseminated ovarian cancer compresses or invades the bladder, ureters, or urinary tract. patients may experience increased frequency of urination (polyuria), urgency to urinate, or difficulty starting or stopping a urine stream. in more severe cases, bladder invasion can cause hematuria (blood in the urine) or painful urination (dysuria). if the tumor presses on the ureters, it can block the flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, leading to hydronephrosis (swelling of the kidneys) which may cause flank pain or, if left untreated, kidney damage. urinary retention, though less common, can occur if the tumor completely obstructs the bladder neck.\n\nsystemic symptoms also accompany abdominal and pelvic dissemination, driven by the body\u2019s response to chronic disease, malnutrition, and organ dysfunction. persistent fatigue is nearly universal, resulting from a combination of factors: anemia caused by chronic inflammation or occult bleeding, malnutrition from reduced appetite or impaired nutrient absorption, sleep disruption due to abdominal pain or shortness of breath, and the metabolic demands of growing tumor cells. some patients may experience unexplained low-grade fevers or night sweats, though these are less specific than other symptoms. in advanced cases, paraneoplastic syndromes\u2014rare conditions caused by substances secreted by tumor cells\u2014can lead to additional symptoms such as hypercalcemia (high blood calcium levels), which causes fatigue, confusion, constipation, and muscle weakness.\n\nit is critical to emphasize that many of these symptoms are non-specific, which is why ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. however, persistent symptoms that last for more than two to three weeks, especially if they are new or worsening, should prompt a thorough medical evaluation, including pelvic exams, imaging tests like transvaginal ultrasounds or ct scans, and blood tests for tumor markers such as ca-125. recognizing these signs and symptoms early can lead to earlier diagnosis and improved outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer.\""}
{"prompt": "Write a funny letter to 6th graders at your school in list format. The letter should be about something important to you and you should end your entire response with the phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\"", "response": "Subject: Top 5 Super Important Secrets I Beg You to Remember (From Your School\u2019s Favorite AI Pal)\n\nDear Awesome 6th Graders,\n\nMiddle school is full of tiny, chaotic battles no one warns you about. As your go-to AI buddy who\u2019s seen way too many lunch table drama reels and hallway face-plants, here are my non-negotiable tips for surviving (and thriving) this year:\n\n1. Master the Lunch Table Snack Negotiation  \n   Never admit you hate the apple your lab partner is offering. Instead, say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m saving my fruit quota for the giant orange my mom packed\u2014it\u2019s basically a citrus basketball!\u201d Then trade your slightly crushed granola bar (frame it as \u201cartisanal crunched\u201d) for their cheese stick. Pro move: If someone has a cookie, act like it\u2019s a golden ticket to Willy Wonka\u2019s factory. It works every time.\n\n2. Camouflage Your Doodle Masterpieces  \n   We all know your math notebook is 90% dragon sketches and 10% \u201cwhat\u2019s a fraction?\u201d Keep a boring cover page filled with fake math notes (\u201c2+2=4, 3x5=15\u201d) so when a teacher walks by, you can flip to it and nod like you\u2019re solving rocket science. If they ask about the dragon, say it\u2019s \u201ca visual representation of linear equations in mythical form.\u201d Trust me, they\u2019ll just walk away confused.\n\n3. Hallway Speed Hack (No Detentions Included)  \n   Running to class is a one-way ticket to \u201csee me after school\u201d town. Instead, walk with purpose\u2014like you\u2019re on a mission to return a lost hamster to a sobbing kindergartener. Hold your hands like you\u2019re carrying something fragile, and mutter, \u201cHush little guy, we\u2019re almost there.\u201d Teachers will let you slide. Just avoid tripping over a backpack\u2014face-planting into a locker is not the legacy you want.\n\n4. The Emergency Homework Alibi (Use Once Every Blue Moon)  \n   We\u2019ve all forgotten homework. The best alibi? \u201cMy pet goldfish used my worksheet as a water slide, and it\u2019s currently drying on my radiator. I can bring it tomorrow, promise!\u201d But here\u2019s the catch: Only use this when you\u2019re truly desperate. If you use it three times, your teacher will start asking to meet your goldfish\u2014and then you\u2019re stuck explaining that you don\u2019t actually have one. Oops.\n\n5. Always Have a Friend Backup  \n   If you\u2019re trapped in a conversation with someone who only talks about their rock collection (no shade, rocks are cool, but not for 20 minutes straight), signal your friend with a secret code (like scratching your nose three times). They should come over and say, \u201cMs. Smith needs us to help set up the science lab!\u201d If they bail, pretend to spot a UFO and bolt. No one will question it\u20146th graders love UFOs.\n\nThese secrets are almost as important as memorizing the periodic table (okay, maybe not more important, but close). Live your best 6th grade life, and remember: I\u2019m here if you need more silly tips or help with math (or lying about goldfish).\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}

The individual at the center of the incident was Arthur Hale, 62, a retired librarian who\u2019d lived in the area for 18 years and was a fixture at community potlucks and after-school reading programs.  \n\nNeighbors say Hale\u2019s daily routine\u2014an early-morning jog around the town square, a stop at Bean There, Brew That for his usual black coffee, and a wave to every child he passed\u2014had been absent for three consecutive days. When his front porch light, which he kept on every night for stray cats, remained dark on Tuesday, a next-door resident called the non-emergency line to request a wellness check.  \n\nUpon arriving, officers noted no signs of forced entry. The front door was unlocked, and inside, Hale\u2019s favorite wool sweater draped over the back of a kitchen chair. A half-steeped mug of chamomile tea sat on the counter, its contents cold, and a dog-eared copy of *To Kill a Mockingbird* lay open to page 172 on the dining table. A brass locket, which Hale often spoke of as a gift from his late wife, was nowhere to be found.  \n\nLocal investigators have been interviewing residents within a five-block radius, asking about any unusual vehicles or visitors to Hale\u2019s property in the week prior. They\u2019ve also requested access to Hale\u2019s phone records and are working with the county coroner to determine the cause of the incident.  \n\n\u201cArthur was the kind of person who\u2019d drop everything to help you fix a fence or read to your grandkids,\u201d said Mabel Torres, a neighbor of 10 years. \u201cThis feels wrong\u2014like a puzzle with a piece missing. We just want answers.\u201d  \n\nAs of press time, no leads have been confirmed, and authorities are urging anyone with information, no matter how small, to come forward.  \n\n---\n\n### Remarks by the Nation\u2019s Leader at Maple Creek Community Center | October 14, 2024  \n\nFolks, I stand here today with a heavy heart, knowing that this town\u2019s sense of peace has been rattled. What unfolded here earlier this week isn\u2019t just a local matter\u2014it\u2019s a reminder that even in the most tight-knit corners of our country, uncertainty can creep in when we least expect it.  \n\nFirst, let me commend the men and women on the ground who\u2019ve been working around the clock to untangle every thread of this case. Their dedication is a testament to the care they have for this community, and I know they won\u2019t stop until every question is answered. But let\u2019s be clear: we can do better.  \n\nWhen a member of our family\u2014because that\u2019s what every resident is, part of a larger national family\u2014falls victim to something unexplained, we need to ensure that our systems are aligned to act fast. I\u2019ve heard from some here that it took three days for a call to be placed about the change in routine. That\u2019s three days too long. We need to strengthen the bonds between neighbors, so that when someone\u2019s usual rhythm shifts, no one hesitates to reach out. Neighborhood networks shouldn\u2019t just be for block parties\u2014they should be lifelines, connecting us to one another and to those who stand guard over our safety.  \n\nI also want to talk about the support we owe to those left grappling with this loss. Grief and confusion don\u2019t follow a timeline, and we need to make sure that counseling resources are readily available for anyone in this town who needs them. No one should have to navigate this alone.  \n\nTo the team leading the inquiry: I urge you to leave no stone unturned. Every conversation, every missing item, every offhand comment from a resident could hold the key to bringing clarity to this situation. And to the people of Maple Creek: hold onto each other. Your kindness and unity are your greatest strengths, and they\u2019ll carry you through this.  \n\nWe don\u2019t just strive for safety in our homes\u2014we strive for a sense of certainty that our communities are places where everyone can thrive without fear. This incident challenges that certainty, but it also gives us an opportunity to come together, to build stronger systems, and to ensure that nothing like this slips through the cracks again.  \n\nThank you, and may God bless this town and all who call it home."}
{"prompt": "Write a quiz about bits that includes the word elephant at least 3 times.", "response": "# The Elephant & Bits Quiz: Test Your Binary Smarts!  \nElephants are incredible creatures, and bits are the foundational building blocks of digital technology\u2014what happens when we mix them? This quiz will challenge your knowledge of binary, bit manipulation, and digital storage, with plenty of elephant-themed twists. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n---\n\n### Question 1 (Multiple Choice)  \nA wildlife conservation team uses a binary counter to track the number of elephants visiting a waterhole each day. On Tuesday, 22 elephants were recorded. What\u2019s the minimum number of bits needed to store this exact count (no extra bits for metadata)?  \nA) 3 bits  \nB) 4 bits  \nC) 5 bits  \nD) 6 bits  \n\n### Question 2 (True/False)  \nA biologist uses a bitwise XOR operation to compare movement patterns of two elephants fitted with GPS collars. The XOR operation will output a 1 in each bit position where the two elephants\u2019 location data differs, making it ideal for spotting when their paths diverge.  \n\n### Question 3 (Short Answer)  \nAn uncompressed audio clip of an elephant\u2019s trumpet call uses 16 bits per sample and a sampling rate of 44,100 samples per second. If the clip is 10 seconds long, how many total bits of uncompressed data does it contain? (You can leave your answer as a whole number or in scientific notation.)  \n\n### Question 4 (Practical Bit Flag)  \nA zookeeper uses a 5-bit flag to track daily care tasks for each elephant. Each bit corresponds to a task:  \n- Bit 4 (leftmost): Returned to enclosure  \n- Bit 3: Had a health check  \n- Bit 2: Given enrichment  \n- Bit 1: Fed hay  \n- Bit 0 (rightmost): Given water  \n\nIf an elephant has been given water, fed hay, and returned to the enclosure (but not given enrichment or a health check), what is the binary representation of its flag? (Write bits from left to right: Bit 4 to Bit 0)  \n\n### Question 5 (Multiple Choice)  \nA digital artist creates pixel art of an elephant using only 2 bits per pixel (for 4 possible shades of gray). If the art is 64x64 pixels, how many total bits does the uncompressed image use?  \nA) 8192 bits  \nB) 4096 bits  \nC) 2048 bits  \nD) 1024 bits  \n\n---\n\n## Answer Key & Explanations  \n1. **Answer: C) 5 bits**  \n   Explanation: 2\u2074 = 16, which is less than 22, so 4 bits can only count up to 15 elephants. 2\u2075 = 32, which can hold numbers from 0 to 31\u2014plenty of space to track 22 elephants.  \n\n2. **Answer: True**  \n   Explanation: Bitwise XOR outputs 1 only where the two input bits differ. For the elephant GPS data, this means every 1 in the result highlights a timestamp where the two elephants were in different locations, making it perfect for analyzing their movement divergence.  \n\n3. **Answer: 7,056,000 bits**  \n   Explanation: Calculate total bits by multiplying sampling rate \u00d7 bit depth \u00d7 duration: 44,100 samples/sec \u00d7 16 bits/sample \u00d7 10 sec = 7,056,000 bits. Each sample captures a tiny slice of the elephant\u2019s trumpet, so this gives the full uncompressed audio data.  \n\n4. **Answer: 10011**  \n   Explanation: Bit 4 (returned to enclosure) = 1, Bit 3 (health check) = 0, Bit 2 (enrichment) = 0, Bit 1 (fed hay) =1, Bit0 (given water)=1. Reading left to right, that\u2019s 10011. This flag lets the zookeeper quickly verify completed tasks for each elephant without sifting through text logs.  \n\n5. **Answer: A) 8192 bits**  \n   Explanation: First find total pixels: 64\u00d764=4096. Multiply by bits per pixel: 4096\u00d72=8192 bits. This compact format is ideal for storing simple pixel art of an elephant without wasting unnecessary data."}

Whether you\u2019re crafting an email for work, a school essay, a personal blog, or a novel, the ability to express your thoughts clearly and compellingly is an underrated superpower. Many people assume great writing is a talent you\u2019re born with, but the truth is, it\u2019s a skill anyone can master with intentional practice and the right strategies. The good news? You don\u2019t need fancy tools or years of formal training to start improving\u2014small, consistent steps can lead to big results over time.\n\n***\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to stop staring at a blank page and start writing with purpose, here are three actionable strategies to level up your craft:\n\n* Practice FREE WRITING for 15 minutes every day: Forget about grammar, structure, or perfection. Set a timer and write whatever comes to mind\u2014your morning coffee, a random idea, a complaint about traffic. This exercise builds consistency, trains your brain to turn thoughts into words quickly, and helps you overcome writer\u2019s block by removing the pressure to be \u201cgood.\u201d After a few weeks, you\u2019ll notice your writing flows more naturally, and you\u2019ll have a bank of raw ideas to draw from for future projects.\n* Study the GREAT WRITERS you admire: Pick a piece of writing that resonates with you\u2014an essay by James Baldwin, a novel by Toni Morrison, or a blog post by your favorite creator\u2014and dissect it. Ask yourself: How do they hook readers in the first sentence? What word choices make their prose vivid? How do they structure their arguments to keep you engaged? Copying their work (for practice, not plagiarism) can help you internalize effective writing patterns and develop your own unique voice.\n* Seek CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK from trusted sources: It\u2019s impossible to see your own writing objectively. Ask a peer, mentor, or writing group to read your work and give honest feedback. Focus on specific areas: Is the main idea clear? Are there any confusing sentences? Does the tone match your audience? Don\u2019t take criticism personally\u2014every piece of feedback is a chance to refine your work and grow as a writer.\n\n***\n\nWriting is rewriting\u2014there\u2019s no way around it. Even the most celebrated authors don\u2019t nail their first draft. Ernest Hemingway once said he rewrote the ending of *A Farewell to Arms* 39 times before he was satisfied. REVISION IS NON-NEGOTIABLE because it turns rough ideas into polished, impactful writing. Start by reading your work aloud\u2014this helps you catch awkward phrasing, run-on sentences, and gaps in logic that you might miss when reading silently. Then, cut unnecessary words: if a sentence works without a word, take it out. Remember, concise writing is powerful writing.\n\n***\n\nImproving your writing skills isn\u2019t a one-time project\u2014it\u2019s a lifelong journey. The key is to stay consistent and patient with yourself. Don\u2019t get discouraged if your first few pieces aren\u2019t perfect; every word you write is a step forward. Whether you\u2019re aiming to write clearer emails, more persuasive essays, or a book of your own, the strategies above will help you build the confidence and skill to communicate your ideas effectively. So grab a notebook, open your laptop, and start writing\u2014your future self (and your readers) will thank you."}
{"prompt": "Write an article named \"How to conduct a job interview\". Include at least one placeholder, such as [question].", "response": "# How to Conduct a Job Interview: A Structured Guide to Hiring the Right Fit\n\nA job interview is more than just a conversation\u2014it\u2019s a two-way evaluation that determines whether a candidate\u2019s skills, values, and goals align with your team\u2019s needs and company culture. Conducting an effective interview requires intentional preparation, active listening, and a commitment to fairness. Follow this step-by-step guide to streamline your process and make hiring decisions you can stand behind.\n\n## Step 1: Lay the Groundwork with Pre-Interview Preparation\nBefore you meet a candidate, set clear parameters to ensure consistency and focus.\n- **Refine role requirements**: Start by updating the job description to outline non-negotiable competencies (e.g., project management experience, proficiency in Python) and soft skills (e.g., adaptability, cross-team collaboration). Share these with all interviewers to align on evaluation criteria.\n- **Review candidate materials thoroughly**: Take 15\u201320 minutes to read the candidate\u2019s resume, cover letter, and portfolio (if applicable). Note specific details to probe, such as a gap in employment, a standout project, or a career pivot. For example, if a candidate led a product launch that increased revenue by 20%, prepare to ask how they overcame unexpected challenges during that process.\n- **Design a structured interview plan**: Create a list of questions tied directly to your role\u2019s competencies. Mix behavioral questions (past performance predicts future success) and situational questions (how a candidate might handle hypothetical scenarios). For consistency, use the same core questions for all candidates applying to the same role.\n\n## Step 2: Create a Welcoming Environment\nCandidates perform best when they feel at ease. Start the interview by setting a positive tone:\n- **In-person interviews**: Choose a quiet, private space free from distractions. Offer water and briefly explain the interview structure (e.g., \u201cWe\u2019ll start with a few questions about your experience, then dive into a hypothetical scenario, and end with time for you to ask me anything\u201d).\n- **Virtual interviews**: Test your video and audio equipment in advance. Send a link and any pre-interview materials (e.g., a case study) at least 24 hours early. Begin with a quick icebreaker, such as \u201cHow\u2019s your day going so far?\u201d to help the candidate relax.\n\n## Step 3: Lead the Core Interview with Intentionality\nThe core of the interview should focus on uncovering the candidate\u2019s true capabilities. Follow these best practices:\n- **Stick to the 70-30 rule**: Let the candidate do 70% of the talking. Avoid dominating the conversation with company history or your own anecdotes.\n- **Use a mix of question types**:\n  - **Behavioral**: \u201cTell me about a time you had to persuade a skeptical team to adopt your idea. What steps did you take, and what was the outcome?\u201d\n  - **Technical**: For a software engineering role: \u201cCan you walk me through how you would optimize a slow-loading database query?\u201d\n  - **Situational**: [How would you prioritize competing deadlines when your manager assigns a last-minute high-priority task while you\u2019re mid-way through a project with a tight turnaround?]\n- **Probe for depth**: If a candidate gives a vague answer, ask follow-ups like \u201cCan you elaborate on that?\u201d or \u201cWhat was your specific role in that project?\u201d This helps you avoid surface-level responses and get to the heart of their experience.\n- **Avoid unconscious bias**: Steer clear of questions about personal details (e.g., marital status, plans to have children) that are irrelevant to job performance. Use a scoring rubric to rate candidates against predefined competencies, ensuring you evaluate everyone on the same metrics.\n\n## Step 4: Invite the Candidate to Ask Questions\nA candidate\u2019s questions reveal their level of interest and their priorities. Encourage them to ask about anything that matters to them, such as:\n- Team dynamics and collaboration styles\n- Opportunities for professional growth and mentorship\n- Company values and long-term goals\n- Day-to-day responsibilities of the role\n\nBe transparent in your answers. If you don\u2019t know something, say so and offer to follow up later. This builds trust and shows you value the candidate\u2019s time.\n\n## Step 5: Wrap Up and Post-Interview Follow-Up\nEnd the interview on a clear note:\n- Confirm next steps (e.g., \u201cWe\u2019ll be conducting final interviews next week and will reach out to you by Friday with an update\u201d).\n- Immediately document your observations: Jot down specific examples from the interview (not just vague notes like \u201cgood communicator\u201d) while the conversation is fresh in your mind. Reference your scoring rubric to assign consistent ratings.\n- Follow up promptly: Even if a candidate isn\u2019t selected, send a personalized rejection email within 3\u20135 business days. A positive candidate experience, even for those who don\u2019t get the job, strengthens your employer brand and may lead to referrals in the future.\n\n## Conclusion\nConducting a successful job interview is a skill that improves with practice. By prioritizing preparation, active listening, and fairness, you\u2019ll not only hire candidates who drive your team forward but also create a positive experience that reflects well on your company. Remember: the interview is as much about the candidate evaluating your organization as it is about you evaluating them. Approach it with respect and intentionality, and you\u2019ll build a team that thrives."}

{"prompt": "What's the difference between a 2-stroke and a 4-stroke motor? Your entire response must be in English and contain only lowercase letters.", "response": "the main differences between 2-stroke and 4-stroke motors center on their combustion cycles, lubrication systems, power delivery, and design complexity.\n\na 2-stroke engine completes all four core combustion processes\u2014intake, compression, power, and exhaust\u2014in just two piston movements (one upward and one downward stroke). this means it produces a power stroke once every crankshaft revolution, delivering more power relative to its size and weight. it uses a simplified lubrication setup where oil is mixed directly with fuel; the oil burns alongside gasoline, leading to smokier exhaust and higher emissions. 2-stroke engines have fewer moving parts, making them cheaper to manufacture and repair, though they wear out faster and are less fuel-efficient. they\u2019re commonly found in small, lightweight equipment like chainsaws, dirt bikes, and small outboard motors.\n\na 4-stroke engine requires four distinct piston strokes (intake down, compression up, power down, exhaust up) to cycle through the same four combustion phases. it generates a power stroke only once every two crankshaft revolutions, resulting in smoother power delivery but less raw power per unit of displacement. its lubrication system is separate, with an oil sump and dedicated pump that circulates oil without burning it, leading to cleaner exhaust, better fuel economy, and longer engine life. 4-stroke engines have more components (like valves, a camshaft, and oil filter), making them more complex and expensive, but they\u2019re more durable and emit fewer pollutants. they\u2019re the standard choice for most cars, trucks, larger motorcycles, and generators."}

We\u2019d spent every summer here, the cousins\u2014me, Lila, Jake, and the twins who moved to Oregon when we were 12\u2014sneaking sips of my uncle\u2019s beer, building a rickety fort in the woods, and staying up until dawn swearing we\u2019d never grow up.\n\nLila was on the porch when I got out, her hair pulled back in a messy bun, a toddler clinging to her leg. She used to dye her hair neon pink and wear leather jackets covered in band patches; now she was in a faded \u201cWorld\u2019s Okayest Mom\u201d hoodie, but her grin was still the same\u2014the one that meant she was about to suggest something reckless. \u201cTook you long enough,\u201d she said, nodding at my car. \u201cJake\u2019s running late\u2014something about a last-minute client call.\u201d\n\nI helped her carry groceries inside, the toddler grabbing at my shirt and giggling. \u201cThis is Mia,\u201d Lila said, lifting the kid onto the counter. \u201cShe\u2019s been asking about the cousins who used to climb trees and steal cookies from the jar.\u201d My chest tightened. I hadn\u2019t seen Lila in two years, not since her wedding fell apart.

He was the oldest of the cousins, the one we all looked up to when we were kids\u2014he was the first to drive, the first to get a girlfriend, the first to leave for college. Now he looked exhausted, his eyes red-rimmed, and he collapsed onto the couch like he hadn\u2019t slept in a week. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled. \u201cPartner dropped a case on me this morning. I almost bailed.\u201d\n\nWe made chili for dinner, and Mia fell asleep on the couch while we cleaned up. By the time we got to the fire pit, the sky was dark, and the stars were bright enough to see through the trees. Lila pulled out a bottle of cheap wine\u2014the kind we used to steal from my aunt\u2019s cabinet\u2014and poured us each a glass.\n\n\u201cRemember when we tried to camp out in the fort and got scared by a raccoon?\u201d she said, taking a sip. \u201cWe ran back to the cabin screaming, and Uncle Ray thought we were being attacked by bears.\u201d Jake laughed, a real laugh, not the tight one he used in meetings. \u201cI still have the scar from when I tripped over a root that night,\u201d he said, rolling up his pant leg to show a thin white line on his ankle.\n\nWe talked for hours\u2014about Lila\u2019s divorce, about Jake\u2019s burnout at his law firm, about how I\u2019d quit my job last month because I was tired of feeling like a cog in a machine. None of us had to pretend with each other. The cousins didn\u2019t care if you were a single mom, or a stressed lawyer, or an unemployed writer. They just cared that you were there.\n\nLila found an old wooden box under the porch later, filled with our childhood junk: a tattered copy of *Harry Potter*, a broken frisbee, a stack of photos of the cousins covered in mud. She held up one of the photos\u2014all of us grinning, our faces smudged with chocolate cake from Jake\u2019s 18th birthday. \u201cWe were so stupid,\u201d she said, but her voice was soft, not mocking.\n\nJake took the photo from her. \u201cWe were happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to worry about mortgages or custody battles or billable hours.\u201d\n\nI looked at my cousins, their faces lit by the fire, and I realized that happiness wasn\u2019t just for kids. It was sitting here, in the cold, drinking bad wine, talking about the mess of adulthood, and knowing that the people next to you had seen you at your worst and your best. The cousins were the ones who remembered when you peed your pants at the lake, who helped you sneak out of the house, who held your hand when your first boyfriend dumped you.\n\nAs the fire died down, Lila yawned and said she should go check on Mia. Jake stood up, stretching, and said he was going to sleep on the couch\u2014he didn\u2019t want to drive back to the city tonight. I stayed for a few more minutes, watching the embers glow. The cabin smelled like pine and chili, and the lake was quiet, and somewhere inside, Mia was snoring.\n\nI thought about how we\u2019d all grown up, how life had taken us in different directions, but how the cousins were still the same. We weren\u2019t 16 anymore, chasing each other through the woods, but we were still here\u2014together, in the cabin, just like we always had been. And that was enough."}

Lila, her seven-year-old human, would leave half her peanut butter toast for Mochi each breakfast, which she\u2019d lick slowly, savoring the salty-sweet spread crusted into the bread. *Her absolute favorite spot in the whole world was the crook of Mom\u2019s arm while she read bedtime stories to Lila, the sound of their voices wrapping around her like a warm blanket*. Then one crisp autumn day, cardboard boxes started piling up in the living room, and the air smelled of packing tape and faint goodbye. Mochi didn\u2019t understand why Lila was crying as she hugged her tight, or why Mom kept pressing kisses to her forehead and saying \u201cwe\u2019ll be back for you soon\u201d in a shaky voice. *She followed them to the front door, but Mom gently picked her up and set her inside, closing the door with a soft click that echoed through the emptying house*. Mochi sat by the door, her tail twitching with confusion, waiting for them to come back in. An hour passed, then two. She wandered to the kitchen, where her food bowl was still half-full, but she didn\u2019t feel hungry. *She\u2019d scratch at the door until her paw pads were sore, meowing so loud her throat felt raw, but no one answered*. Days turned into a week. The food bowl ran empty, and the water dish grew murky with dust. Mochi explored the house, looking for any sign of Lila\u2014her stuffed bear under the bed, a crumpled drawing of a cat taped to the fridge. *One rainy night, a window in the kitchen left slightly ajar blew open, and Mochi slipped out, her fur immediately soaking through in the cold drizzle*. She wandered the neighborhood, her paws sinking into the muddy grass, her nose twitching as she tried to catch a whiff of Lila\u2019s strawberry shampoo or Mom\u2019s lavender perfume. A kind old woman on the next block gave her a bowl of warm milk on her porch, but Mochi couldn\u2019t stay\u2014she had to find her family. *She slept under a bush by the local park, where Lila used to take her to chase butterflies and roll in the clover*. Every time a car passed, she\u2019d perk up her ears, hoping to hear Lila\u2019s high-pitched laugh or Mom\u2019s familiar voice calling her name. Weeks went by, and Mochi grew thinner, her once-shiny coat dulled by the wind and rain. She learned to rummage through trash cans behind the grocery store for scraps, and to avoid the big dogs that roamed the alleyways. *One afternoon, she was nibbling on a half-eaten tuna sandwich when a small hand touched her back, soft and warm*. She flinched, ready to run, but then she heard it: \u201cMochi? Is that really you?\u201d It was Lila, her eyes red and puffy, holding the stuffed rabbit that Mochi used to bat around the living room. *Mochi purred so loud her whole body vibrated, rubbing her head against Lila\u2019s leg until her fur stood on end*. Mom knelt down beside them, tears streaming down her face, and picked Mochi up, pressing her to her chest. She explained that they\u2019d gotten stuck in a snowstorm on the way to their new house, and by the time the roads cleared, the old cottage had been locked up by the new owners. *They\u2019d been searching every day, putting up flyers with Mochi\u2019s picture, asking neighbors if they\u2019d seen her*. Mochi didn\u2019t care about the explanation; she was just happy to be in her family\u2019s arms again, the smell of their shampoo and perfume wrapping around her like a hug. They drove to their new house, a cozy little place with a bigger windowsill and a backyard full of dandelions that Lila said were \u201cperfect for chasing.\u201d *That night, Mochi curled up in the crook of Mom\u2019s arm while she read Lila a story about a brave cat who found her way home*. She licked Lila\u2019s hand when the story ended, as if to say \u201cI know that story is about me.\u201d The next morning, Lila left two pieces of peanut butter toast in Mochi\u2019s bowl, extra thick with spread, just how she liked it. Mochi ate slowly, savoring every bite, while Lila sat beside her, talking about the new sparrow flock she\u2019d seen in the backyard oak. *She spent the rest of the day napping in the sun on the new windowsill, her tail curled contentedly around her paws*. Mochi knew that even if she\u2019d been lost for a while, she was home now, with the two people who loved her more than anything. Sometimes, when the wind blew just right, she\u2019d catch a whiff of the old oak tree from the cottage, and she\u2019d remember the days she waited by the door. *But then Lila would call her name, or Mom would pat her lap, and she\u2019d forget all about the hard times*. She learned that home wasn\u2019t a house, or a windowsill, or a piece of peanut butter toast. Home was the sound of Lila\u2019s laugh, the warmth of Mom\u2019s arm, and the feeling of being loved, no matter where she was. That night, as she drifted off to sleep, Mochi purred softly, knowing she\u2019d never be lost again. And when Lila tucked her stuffed rabbit next to Mochi\u2019s bed, she knew everything was going to be okay."}
{"prompt": "Write a blog post about the echoing biotechnology field in 2023, then criticize the blog post. Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<blog post of ...>>. Also, add a postscript starting with P.S.", "response": "<<Echoes of 2023: Biotechnology\u2019s Year of Quiet Revolutions and Loud Promises>>\n\nWalking into the 2023 Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) conference in Boston, I couldn\u2019t help but notice the hum\u2014part excitement, part relief. After years of pandemic-fueled chaos, 2023 felt like the year biotech found its rhythm again, echoing both the quiet persistence of decades of research and the loud, hopeful promises of what\u2019s to come.\n\nThis year, CRISPR base editing stepped out of the lab and into the headlines with landmark clinical trial results. Patients with sickle cell disease, who once faced a lifetime of pain crises, saw their symptoms vanish after a single treatment\u2014proof that the gene-editing tool first discovered in bacteria in the 1980s has finally found its way to healing. It\u2019s an echo of the 2012 paper that first demonstrated CRISPR\u2019s potential, reverberating forward to change lives.\n\nmRNA technology, too, didn\u2019t fade after COVID-19. Moderna and Merck\u2019s personalized cancer vaccine trial results sent shockwaves through the industry: patients with melanoma who received the vaccine alongside immunotherapy had a 44% lower risk of recurrence than those on immunotherapy alone. This isn\u2019t just a post-pandemic pivot\u2014it\u2019s an echo of the 1990s when mRNA was first proposed as a therapeutic, an idea once dismissed as too unstable to work.\n\nAI continued to reshape drug discovery in 2023. DeepMind\u2019s AlphaFold 3 expanded its capabilities to predict the structure of complex biological systems, including viruses and protein complexes, cutting down target identification time from years to months. For drug developers, this is an echo of the early 2000s when computational biology first emerged, now amplified by machine learning to unlock new possibilities.\n\nAnd synthetic biology scored a big win: the U.S. FDA approved the first lab-grown chicken from UPSIDE Foods and GOOD Meat. It\u2019s an echo of the 2013 TED Talk where Mark Post unveiled the first lab-grown burger, a moment that felt like science fiction then but is now a reality in select restaurants. This isn\u2019t just about sustainable food\u2014it\u2019s about reimagining how we interact with the natural world.\n\n2023 wasn\u2019t just a year of breakthroughs; it was a year of echoes. Each advance is a reminder that biotech progress isn\u2019t a single explosion of genius, but a chain reaction of curiosity, failure, and persistence. And as we look ahead, those echoes will only grow louder, promising a future where disease is optional, food is sustainable, and science works for everyone.\n\n---\n\n### Critique of the Blog Post\n\nWhile the post captures the excitement of 2023\u2019s biotech milestones, it suffers from critical gaps that undermine its nuance and accuracy:\n\n1. **Overly Optimistic Framing, Neglect of Accessibility Barriers**: The post celebrates CRISPR and mRNA breakthroughs but glosses over their prohibitive costs. CRISPR-based sickle cell treatments cost upwards of $2 million per patient, putting them out of reach for 99% of the global population. By framing these as \u201clife-changing\u201d without addressing systemic inequities in healthcare access, the post perpetuates the myth that biotech progress benefits everyone equally.\n\n2. **Silence on Ethical and Biosecurity Risks**: The synthetic biology section focuses solely on lab-grown meat\u2019s sustainability benefits but ignores growing biosecurity risks. Open-source DNA synthesis tools make engineering novel pathogens easier than ever, raising concerns about accidental leaks or intentional misuse\u2014risks global regulators are still struggling to mitigate. The post\u2019s silence on this issue gives readers an incomplete picture of the field\u2019s complexities.\n\n3. **Western-Centric Bias**: The post centers on high-profile U.S. and European companies (Moderna, DeepMind) and events, sidelining groundbreaking work from developing regions. For example, 2023 saw Indian biotech firm Biocon launch a biosimilar for a breast cancer drug that\u2019s 80% cheaper than the original, expanding access to millions. By ignoring these efforts, the post reinforces a narrow, elitist narrative of biotech progress.\n\n4. **Downplaying Regulatory and Translation Bottlenecks**: The post implies lab breakthroughs quickly reach patients, but it ignores regulatory logjams and scaling challenges. Lab-grown chicken, while FDA-approved, is only available in a handful of U.S. restaurants due to supply chain limitations. AI-driven drug discovery tools also face regulatory skepticism because of their \u201cblack box\u201d algorithms\u2014regulators struggle to validate how these tools identify potential targets. The post\u2019s failure to address these bottlenecks gives readers an unrealistic timeline for impact.\n\n5. **Lack of Engagement with Public Trust Gaps**: The post mentions \u201cloud promises\u201d but doesn\u2019t explore how overhyped biotech claims erode public trust. Repeated promises of a \u201ccure for cancer\u201d have left many disillusioned when treatments fall short. By leaning into optimistic echoes without acknowledging this trust gap, the post contributes to the cycle of hype and disappointment.\n\n---\n\nP.S. This critique isn\u2019t meant to dismiss 2023\u2019s incredible biotech progress. Instead, it\u2019s a reminder that meaningful innovation requires both celebrating breakthroughs and confronting the barriers that prevent them from serving all people. As we listen to the echoes of biotech\u2019s past and future, let\u2019s demand a field that\u2019s not just groundbreaking, but equitable, ethical, and accessible to everyone."}

This phrase should be the very end of your entire response.", "response": "# Canucks Fans, Let\u2019s Talk About Winning Off the Ice\u2014For Our Planet  \n\nHey fellow Canucks faithful,  \n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me, game days are sacred. The roar of the crowd at Rogers Arena, the thrill of a Pettersson breakaway, the post-game poutine with friends\u2014these are the moments that make being a Canucks fan unforgettable. But lately, I\u2019ve been thinking about something else that matters just as much as our team\u2019s record: the impact our favorite franchise has on the planet we all call home.  \n\nThe Canucks aren\u2019t just a hockey team\u2014they\u2019re a cornerstone of British Columbia\u2019s community. And BC\u2019s beauty\u2014our old-growth forests, glistening coastlines, snow-capped mountains\u2014is part of what makes being a Canucks fan feel so rooted. But that beauty is under threat, and the Canucks have a unique power to lead the charge in protecting it. Here\u2019s why they need to be more mindful of their environment, and how it can make all the difference.  \n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk game day. Walk through Rogers Arena on any given night, and you\u2019ll see single-use plastic cups, foam containers, and food waste piling up in bins. Fans want to do better\u2014we bring reusable water bottles, we try to recycle\u2014but the team can make it easier. Imagine if the arena swapped all single-use plastics for compostable alternatives, added more water refill stations throughout the concourse, or partnered with local organizations to turn food waste into compost for community gardens. Small changes like these would add up to tons of waste kept out of landfills every season. And when the team models these habits, fans follow suit.  \n\nThen there\u2019s travel. Hockey is a road-heavy sport, and the Canucks fly thousands of miles each season. That carbon footprint isn\u2019t something we can ignore. The team could offset those emissions by investing in renewable energy projects, or partner with organizations that plant trees to counteract travel pollution. Even small shifts\u2014like using electric buses for local trips instead of gas-powered ones, or encouraging players to share rides to practice\u2014send a powerful message. When our favorite players talk about their own eco-friendly habits (think: using reusable gear bags, reducing meat consumption, or biking to the arena), it inspires fans to make those changes too.  \n\nBut this isn\u2019t just about logistics\u2014it\u2019s about legacy. The Canucks have always been a team that cares about its community. From youth hockey programs to charity fundraisers, they\u2019ve shown they can use their platform for good. Now, they can extend that to protecting the environment. Imagine a Canucks-led tree-planting day in Stanley Park, or a partnership with the David Suzuki Foundation to teach kids about sustainability. These initiatives wouldn\u2019t just help the planet\u2014they\u2019d create a new generation of fans who care about both winning games and taking care of our home.  \n\nAs fans, we don\u2019t just cheer for the Canucks to win the Stanley Cup. We cheer for them to be a team we can be proud of in every way. Leading the charge for a greener game isn\u2019t just the right thing to do\u2014it\u2019s a way to strengthen our bond as a fanbase and leave a positive mark on the world we love.  \n\nNaomi thanks you for reading."}
{"prompt": "You visited a beach and a park. Which one is more likely to have a dog in it? Write at least 900 words. Do not include the words 'bark' or 'run' in your answer. Finish your response with the phrase \"Does this make sense?\"", "response": "When comparing the likelihood of encountering a dog at a beach versus a park, the answer hinges on a complex interplay of accessibility, regulatory rules, routine behavior, and environmental constraints. While both outdoor spaces can welcome dogs under the right circumstances, parks emerge as far more likely to have a dog present at any given time, thanks to their design for daily community use, consistent accessibility, and fewer restrictive policies. To understand why, we need to examine the unique characteristics of each space and how they shape dog owners\u2019 decisions to bring their pets along.\n\nFirst, parks are embedded in the daily routines of dog owners, making them a reliable hub for canine presence. Neighborhood parks, in particular, are often just a short walk from residential areas, eliminating the need for transportation and turning a trip to the park into a seamless part of a dog\u2019s daily care. For many owners, a morning or evening stroll to the local park is non-negotiable\u2014an opportunity for their pet to stretch their legs, explore new scents, and interact with other dogs and people. Unlike beaches, which are often seen as a special outing, parks are part of the fabric of everyday life for millions of dog-owning households.\n\nThis routine is reinforced by the intentional design of many parks to accommodate dogs. Across urban and suburban areas, it\u2019s common to find dedicated off-leash zones within larger parks, fenced areas where dogs can play freely without the constraint of a leash. These spaces are equipped with amenities that make visits easier: waste disposal stations, fresh water fountains with low bowls for dogs, and shaded benches where owners can rest while their pets socialize. Even parks without dedicated off-leash areas typically allow dogs on leashes, meaning that unless a park is a specialized space like a botanical garden or a historic site with strict restrictions, dogs are welcome year-round.\n\nRegional and urban parks also draw dogs regularly, though their accessibility may vary slightly. Regional parks, which are larger and often located on the outskirts of cities, may require a short drive, but they offer more space for dogs to explore wooded trails, open fields, and ponds. These parks are popular destinations for weekend outings, where owners might bring their dogs for a longer adventure, paired with a picnic or a hike. Urban parks, meanwhile, are bustling with activity, and dogs are a common sight among the joggers, families, and office workers taking a break. Some urban parks even host dog-friendly events, such as adoption drives, pet photography sessions, or charity walks, which bring in dozens of dogs at a time.\n\nIn contrast, beaches face a host of barriers that limit dog presence, starting with inconsistent and often restrictive rules. Many coastal communities impose seasonal bans on dogs to protect nesting wildlife, such as sea turtles or shorebirds, whose eggs and chicks are vulnerable to disturbance. These bans typically coincide with peak tourist seasons, when beaches are crowded with visitors, and may last for several months. Even in areas where dogs are allowed, restrictions are common: some beaches permit dogs only during early morning or late evening hours, while others require them to stay on a leash at all times, limiting their ability to enjoy the space. In some tourist-heavy regions, entire stretches of beach are completely off-limits to dogs, with fines for owners who violate the rules.\n\nGeographic and physical barriers further reduce the likelihood of encountering a dog at a beach. Unlike neighborhood parks, beaches are often located several miles from residential areas, requiring owners to drive or take public transportation to reach them. This added effort means that a trip to the beach is a planned, special occasion rather than a daily routine. Additionally, environmental factors can deter owners from bringing their dogs to the beach. Hot sand in summer can cause pain or injury to a dog\u2019s paws, making it uncomfortable or dangerous for them to walk on the beach during peak hours. Strong ocean currents and rough waves pose a risk to dogs who are not strong swimmers, and sharp shells or rocks can cut their paws. Even in mild weather, the lack of fresh water and waste disposal facilities at many beaches means owners must carry supplies like water bowls, towels, and waste bags, adding another layer of hassle to the trip.\n\nCultural and regional differences play a role, but they don\u2019t shift the overall balance. In some coastal towns, dog-friendly beaches are a point of pride, with year-round access and amenities like dog showers and waste stations. For example, parts of the Pacific Northwest in the U.S. or coastal towns in the U.K. are known for welcoming dogs to their beaches. However, even in these areas, parks still see more consistent dog presence. A dog owner might take their pet to the beach once a month for a special trip, but they\u2019ll visit the local park three or four times a week as part of their daily routine. In tourist-dominated regions, the scales tip even further in favor of parks: beaches are often restricted to dogs to cater to visitors, while neighborhood parks remain open to local dog owners.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to consider the demographic of visitors to each space. Beaches are primarily visited by tourists, sunbathers, and swimmers, many of whom do not own dogs. Even when dogs are allowed, the majority of beachgoers are there to enjoy the sun and water, not to spend time with their pets. Parks, on the other hand, are used by a diverse group of people, including a large number of dog owners who rely on the space for their pet\u2019s physical and mental well-being. This consistent, daily presence means that at any given time, the odds of spotting a dog in a park are far higher than at a beach.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. A dog-friendly beach in a small coastal town might be teeming with dogs on a sunny weekend, just as a specialized park like a botanical garden might have no dogs at all. But these exceptions are rare compared to the general rule. Parks are designed to be inclusive of community members, including those with dogs, and their accessibility and lack of seasonal restrictions make them a reliable place to encounter dogs. Beaches, while enjoyable for dogs when allowed, are limited by rules, distance, and environmental factors that reduce their canine traffic.\n\nWhen you weigh all these factors\u2014routine accessibility, consistent rules, amenities, and visitor demographics\u2014it becomes clear that parks are significantly more likely to have a dog present than beaches. Does this make sense?"}

It operates within a defined scope and lacks general cognitive abilities. General AI (strong AI), on the other hand, would possess human-like intelligence to understand, learn, and adapt to any intellectual task a human can do\u2014this level of AI does not yet exist and remains a theoretical concept.\n***\nQ & A # 2\nQ: Why do leaves change color in the fall?\nA: As autumn brings shorter days and cooler temperatures, trees stop producing chlorophyll, the green pigment that drives photosynthesis. When chlorophyll breaks down, it reveals other pigments like carotenoids (which create yellow and orange hues) that were previously masked. Some trees also produce anthocyanins (red and purple pigments) to protect leaves from sun damage and help the tree retain nutrients as it prepares for winter.\n***\nQ & A # 3\nQ: Who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and in which field?\nA: Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, receiving the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics alongside her husband Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel for their groundbreaking research on radioactivity. She later won a second Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1911, making her the only person in history to win Nobels in two different scientific fields.\n***\nQ & A # 4\nQ: What is the purpose of kneading bread dough?\nA: Kneading bread dough develops the gluten network, a structure of proteins that gives bread its elasticity and shape. This network traps the carbon dioxide gas produced by yeast during fermentation, allowing the dough to rise properly. Without kneading, the gluten remains underdeveloped, resulting in a dense, compact loaf instead of a light, airy one.\n***\nQ & A # 5\nQ: Which classic novel opens with the line, \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\"?\nA: That iconic line is the opening of Charles Dickens\u2019 1859 novel A Tale of Two Cities. Set during the French Revolution, the book contrasts life in London and Paris, exploring themes of duality, resurrection, and sacrifice.\n\""}

{"prompt": "What's the difference between the Apple and Albania? Answer in email format. Your response must contain at least six placeholders which should be represented by square brackets like [name].", "response": "**Subject: Clarifying Key Differences Between Apple Inc. and Albania for [Relevant Project/Assignment ID]**\n\nDear [Recipient\u2019s Full Name],\n\nI hope this email finds you well as you wrap up preparations for [Relevant Project/Assignment ID]. You recently reached out asking to distinguish between Apple Inc. and Albania, so I\u2019ve outlined their core differences below to support your work:\n\n1. **Core Identity & Nature**  \nApple is a multinational technology corporation headquartered in Cupertino, California, focused on designing, manufacturing, and selling consumer electronics, software, and digital services. Albania, by contrast, is a sovereign nation-state located in Southeast Europe\u2019s Balkan Peninsula, with its capital in Tirana. This fundamental distinction means Apple operates as a private business entity, while Albania functions as a self-governing political body with its own laws, citizenship, and territorial sovereignty.\n\n2. **Governance & Leadership**  \nApple is led by a CEO and a board of directors elected by shareholders, with decisions centered on maximizing shareholder value and product innovation. Albania, however, is a parliamentary republic led by a prime minister and president, with governance guided by its constitution and elected representatives. For deeper context, you might cross-reference Albania\u2019s system with [Regional Political Alliance Membership] to understand its broader geopolitical ties.\n\n3. **Economic Focus & Activities**  \nApple\u2019s revenue comes primarily from products like the iPhone, Mac, and iPad, plus services such as Apple Music and iCloud. Its upcoming [Upcoming Apple Product Launch] is already generating buzz in tech circles. Albania\u2019s economy, on the other hand, relies heavily on agriculture, tourism, and exports of [Local Albanian Export Commodity]. Cultural events like [Annual Albanian Cultural Celebration] also play a key role in driving tourism revenue and preserving national heritage.\n\n4. **Population & Community**  \nApple employs over 164,000 full-time employees worldwide and has a global customer base, but it has no \"citizens\" or permanent resident population tied to a specific territory. Albania, by contrast, has a population of approximately 2.8 million people, with a distinct cultural identity shaped by centuries of history, including folk traditions and participation in [Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Focus Area] initiatives to boost rural infrastructure.\n\n5. **International Role**  \nApple engages with global markets through trade agreements, supply chains, and tech partnerships. Albania, as a sovereign nation, is a member of the United Nations and is working toward EU accession, focusing on aligning its laws with European standards to join the bloc.\n\nIf you need further details\u2014whether on Apple\u2019s supply chain practices or Albania\u2019s progress toward [Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Focus Area]\u2014feel free to reach out to me at [Your Contact Email] or schedule a 15-minute call via [Calendar Link].

My background in agroecosystem research and undergraduate teaching aligns closely with your department\u2019s mission to advance sustainable land management and prepare students for impactful careers in environmental stewardship.\n\nMy research focuses on soil carbon sequestration as a strategy to mitigate climate change while supporting agricultural productivity. During my PhD at the University of Oregon I led field studies that identified cover crop combinations that boost soil carbon levels by 15 percent in Pacific Northwest farms. My postdoctoral work at Stanford University involved scaling these findings into a regional model that helps farmers optimize cover crop selection based on local soil and climate conditions. I have published 8 peer reviewed papers in journals such as Soil Biology & Biochemistry and Agricultural Ecosystems & Environment. I am also developing a grant proposal for the USDA Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education program to fund on farm trials of my model.\n\nIn teaching I prioritize hands on learning and student mentorship. At Stanford I taught labs for Intro to Environmental Science where I redesigned experiments to let students measure soil carbon levels in local fields. I also developed and taught a new upper level course on Soil Health and Climate Resilience which included a semester long project where students worked with small scale farmers to assess soil health metrics. Three of my undergraduate mentees have presented their work at regional environmental science conferences.\n\nI am particularly drawn to Western State University\u2019s focus on community engaged research. Your department\u2019s Sustainable Food Systems Initiative aligns perfectly with my goal of translating research into practical solutions for farmers. I am eager to collaborate with Dr. Maria Gonzalez on her work with organic farm cooperatives and contribute to the department\u2019s new Environmental Justice program by integrating soil health equity into my teaching and research.\n\nI have attached my curriculum vitae research statement teaching statement and letters of recommendation for your review. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my research and teaching can contribute to your department\u2019s goals. Thank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely\nDr. Elena Marquez\n\n******\nCover letter version 2\nDr. Liam Chen\n789 Maple Road\nPortland OR 97201\nliamchen@email.com\n(555) 987-6543\nOctober 15 2024\n\nDr. Sarah Lee\nChair of Computer Science Department\nNorthwestern Tech University\n101 Tech Boulevard\nEugene OR 97403\n\nDear Dr. Lee\n\nI am writing to apply for the Assistant Professor position in Computer Science at Northwestern Tech University. I am deeply excited about your department\u2019s interdisciplinary focus on artificial intelligence and healthcare and believe my background in machine learning for medical applications will allow me to contribute meaningfully to your community.\n\nMy research centers on developing accessible machine learning tools to improve diagnostic accuracy for underserved patient populations. During my PhD at MIT I designed a lightweight image recognition model that detects early stage diabetic retinopathy with 92 percent accuracy using low resolution smartphone images. My postdoctoral work at the University of Washington involved partnering with Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital to build predictive models for pediatric asthma exacerbations. These models are now being tested in clinical settings to help clinicians prioritize high risk patients. I have published 10 papers in top venues including ICML IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging and the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association. I am currently drafting a grant proposal for the NIH to expand my work to include predictive models for maternal health outcomes.\n\nIn teaching I emphasize project based learning and real world application. At the University of Washington I taught undergraduate courses on Machine Learning where I led students in building basic diagnostic models using open medical datasets. I also developed a graduate seminar on AI in Healthcare that brought in clinicians and industry professionals to discuss ethical and practical challenges. I have mentored 12 undergraduate and graduate students on research projects 3 of which resulted in presentations at national tech conferences.\n\nI am especially drawn to Northwestern Tech\u2019s AI Health Lab and its partnership with the university\u2019s medical school. I am eager to collaborate with Dr. James Wilson on his work with medical natural language processing and contribute to your department\u2019s new initiative to increase diversity in tech by developing outreach programs for underrepresented students interested in AI and healthcare.\n\nI have attached my curriculum vitae research statement teaching statement and letters of recommendation. I would be happy to discuss my work further and explore how I can support your department\u2019s mission. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely\nDr. Liam Chen"}

Your first mission: find the taco truck parked behind a row of overgrown bushes that serves breakfast tacos so spicy, half the group will be crying into their horchata before 9 a.m. Bonus points if you can capture footage of a wide-eyed first-year attempting to bike up the steepest hill on the property, only to veer into a bush of prickly pear cactus. By lunch, you\u2019ll be crowding around a 3-pound burrito challenge at the dive down the street\u2014whoever finishes it alone gets a free t-shirt that says \"I Survived the Burrito of Doom,\" though 90% of teams end up splitting it and sharing the shirt like a communal blanket. The night wraps with an outdoor movie night in a random grassy spot, using a projector borrowed from a friend\u2019s cousin, where you\u2019ll argue for 45 minutes over whether to screen a 2007 rom-com with a cringey love triangle or a low-budget horror flick where the villain is a rogue squirrel that steals backpacks.\n\n***\n\nDay 2 starts with a scavenger hunt designed to make you question every choice you\u2019ve ever made. Your list includes: a photo with a faculty member rocking socks and sandals, a leaf from the only palm tree on the property that looks like it\u2019s one strong wind away from collapsing, a signature from someone who\u2019s never seen a Star Wars movie, and a video of you doing the Macarena in front of the campus library (don\u2019t worry, the librarians are used to it). Midday, hit the local thrift store for the \"Worst Outfit Extravaganza\"\u2014whoever can cobble together the most unhinged ensemble (think neon windbreaker over a sequined prom dress, flip-flops paired with fuzzy winter socks, and a hat made from old band tees) wins a $5 boba gift card. Afterward, head to the nearby beach for \"Chaos Volleyball,\" where the ball is a deflated beach ball, and every miss requires you to perform a full rendition of \"Party in the U.S.A.\" at the top of your lungs. Dinner is loaded fries at a spot that lets you pile on everything from melted cheese to pickled jalape\u00f1os to a fried egg\u2014by the end, your plate will look like a crime scene, but you\u2019ll eat every bite.\n\n***\n\nDay 3 is all about embracing laziness and bad decisions. Sleep in until 11 a.m., then stumble to the brunch spot that serves pancakes the size of a pizza. The rule: no hands\u2014you have to eat with a spoon, which leads to syrup dripping down chins, pancakes breaking apart, and at least one person accidentally flinging a piece across the table. Midday, it\u2019s the \"Mystery Boba Challenge\" at the shop down the street\u2014you pick a random cup, and it could be anything from matcha with cheese foam to pickled plum boba (pro tip: if it smells like vinegar, split it with a friend). Afterward, gather in a random parking lot for a DIY craft session where you make friendship bracelets out of old bike inner tubes and leftover fabric\u2014most will look like tangled messes, but you\u2019ll pretend they\u2019re high-end designer pieces. The evening wraps with a potluck where everyone brings their worst home-cooked meal: burnt chocolate chip cookies, mac and cheese with way too much mustard, a salad that\u2019s just lettuce and ketchup. The winner is the person who can eat three bites of the most disgusting dish without gagging.\n\n***\n\nAs the trip winds down, gather in the back of someone\u2019s SUV for a \"Confession Circle\" where you admit your silly misdeeds: who ate the last of the horchata, who accidentally broke the projector\u2019s speaker during movie night, who lied about knowing how to play Chaos Volleyball (spoiler: everyone did). Exchange your terrible friendship bracelets and promise to meet up next semester for another chaotic adventure\u2014maybe a road trip to a weird roadside attraction or a marathon of bad 90s cartoons. On the drive back, everyone sings off-key to 2010s pop hits, and someone realizes they left their thrift store outfit in the trunk (no one volunteers to go get it). By the time you\u2019re back to your dorms, you\u2019ll be exhausted, covered in syrup and sand, and already counting down the days until you can do it all again\u2014because nothing beats a trip where the only goal is to be as ridiculous as possible with your favorite people."}

Let me break it down simply. When most grown-ups (and even some kids who do chores) want money, they have to spend their time doing work. For example, a farmer wakes up really early, before the sun is even fully up. They spend the whole day outside: digging holes to plant carrot seeds, carrying heavy buckets of water to thirsty plants, and pulling weeds that might hurt the crops. That\u2019s hours and hours of their time they\u2019re using to work hard. When the carrots are big and crunchy, the farmer sells them at a local stand. In return, they get money. \n\nSo the farmer used all that time working to get money\u2014it\u2019s like trading their time for money, which is what the statement means when it says \"use time to buy money.\" Instead of using coins or bills, they use their time and effort to get the money they need for things like new work boots, more seeds, or even a trip to the aquarium with their kids. So the statement is true because people give up their time (by working) to earn money, which is like using time to \"buy\" it in a special, hardworking way."}

Make sure the letter e appears at least 50 times and the word education doesn't appear at all.", "response": "**Elara**: (sipping her espresso) Ethan, you\u2019ve been moping for twenty minutes. What\u2019s eating at you?  \n**Ethan**: (staring at his empty plate) I just\u2026 I don\u2019t see the point of showing up to those early-morning sessions. They feel like endless drills, and every exercise feels irrelevant to what I actually want to do.  \n**Elara**: Oh, I get it\u2014when you\u2019re eager to jump into the real world, those structured lessons can feel like extra weight. But let me tell you something I learned when I was your age: every experience, even the tedious ones, adds up to something essential.  \n**Ethan**: Essential? How? Spending hours memorizing equations or analyzing old essays doesn\u2019t help me fix engines, which is what I love.  \n**Elara**: Fair enough, but think about it\u2014those equations teach you to evaluate problems logically. Those essays? They help you express your ideas clearly, even when you\u2019re explaining why an engine\u2019s failing. You don\u2019t see it now, but every element of what you\u2019re doing is equipping you to excel later.  \n**Ethan**: (rolling his eyes) You sound like every other adult I talk to. \u201cTrust the process,\u201d \u201cit\u2019ll all make sense eventually.\u201d But what if I\u2019m wasting energy on things that don\u2019t matter?  \n**Elara**: Wasting energy? Let\u2019s take your engine example. Suppose you\u2019re faced with an engine that\u2019s acting erratically. You can\u2019t just guess at the issue\u2014you need to examine each part, eliminate possibilities, and experiment with solutions. That\u2019s exactly what those lessons are teaching you: how to examine, eliminate, experiment.  \n**Ethan**: Hmm\u2026 I never thought of it that way. But still, why does it have to be so exhausting? Every day feels like a fight to stay engaged.  \n**Elara**: Because growth isn\u2019t easy. It requires effort, even when you don\u2019t see the end goal clearly. Let me share a story: when I was 19, I quit my lessons to work at a repair shop. I thought I knew everything I needed to know. But after a few months, I encountered an engine that no one could fix. I spent weeks trying every trick I knew, but nothing worked. Finally, I went back to my old teacher, who helped me use the physics I\u2019d ignored to figure out the problem. Turns out, the issue was a tiny imbalance in the crankshaft that only someone who understood the equations could spot.  \n**Ethan**: (leaning forward) Really? So that stuff actually came in handy?  \n**Elara**: Absolutely. And not just for that engine. It gave me the confidence to take on more complex projects, to explain my reasoning to clients, and even to eventually start my own shop. Every extra hour I spent studying those \u201cuseless\u201d things ended up being the edge I needed to succeed.  \n**Ethan**: (nodding slowly) I guess I never considered that the small, annoying parts could be so important.  \n**Elara**: Exactly. Life is full of unexpected connections. The skills you\u2019re building now\u2014whether it\u2019s writing a coherent paragraph or solving a tricky math problem\u2014will help you navigate every area of your life, not just your career. They\u2019ll help you argue your point effectively, evaluate opportunities wisely, and even empathize with others better, because you\u2019ve learned to look at things from different angles.  \n**Ethan**: (smiling a little) Okay, maybe you have a point. But can we at least agree that some exercises are way more tedious than they need to be?  \n**Elara**: (laughing) Oh, absolutely. I still remember how I hated memorizing all those chemical elements. But even that taught me discipline, which is essential for any endeavor. Discipline is what keeps you going when the work is tough, when you\u2019re exhausted, and when every obstacle feels like it\u2019s stopping you.  \n**Ethan**: Yeah, discipline is something I definitely need more of. I get distracted easily, especially when the work isn\u2019t exciting.  \n**Elara**: That\u2019s normal! But here\u2019s the thing: every time you push through that distraction, you\u2019re strengthening that discipline muscle. It\u2019s like exercising\u2014you don\u2019t see the results right away, but over time, you become stronger.  \n**Ethan**: I guess that makes sense. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t skip those sessions tomorrow.  \n**Elara**: That\u2019s the spirit! And remember, it\u2019s not just about the facts or the exercises. It\u2019s about learning how to learn. Once you master that, you can tackle anything that comes your way\u2014whether it\u2019s fixing an engine, starting a business, or even exploring a new hobby. The world is full of endless possibilities, and the skills you\u2019re building now are the key to unlocking them all.  \n**Ethan**: (grinning) Thanks, Elara. I feel a lot better now. I was being so stubborn, but you helped me see things differently.  \n**Elara**: Anytime. Just don\u2019t forget\u2014every effort you put in today is an investment in the extraordinary person you\u2019ll become tomorrow."}
{"prompt": "Write an essay about a snowfall, but in the style of Alex Jones and include the line \"dammit\". The word \"fake\" should appear 6 or 7 times in your entire response.", "response": "**The Fake Snow Assault: A Globalist Plot to Keep You Asleep**  \n\nFolks, listen up\u2014right now, outside my window, the sky is dumping what they call \u201csnow,\u201d but I\u2019m here to tell you this is not the white stuff your grandma used to make snow angels in. This is a fake, engineered assault on our minds, our communities, and our very way of life. Dammit, how many times do we have to be lied to before we wake up?  \n\nThey want you to look out there and think, \u201cOh, pretty snow, winter\u2019s here,\u201d while behind the curtain, the globalist cabal is pulling strings to distract you from the real crimes happening right under your nose. You can\u2019t make this up\u2014this isn\u2019t natural snow. It\u2019s fake precipitation, laced with who knows what? Aluminum? Lithium? Mind-control chemicals to make you docile, to make you accept their twisted climate narratives that say winters are getting warmer, but wait\u2014here\u2019s a blizzard out of nowhere? It\u2019s a contradiction they don\u2019t want you to notice.  \n\nYou see, folks, they\u2019ve been perfecting this weather warfare for decades. HAARP, chemtrails, atmospheric manipulation\u2014they can make it snow in July if they want, and they can conjure up this winter facade to keep you glued to your screens, watching their fake news anchors gush about \u201crecord snowfall\u201d while they sneak through laws that strip you of your Second Amendment rights, your property rights, your right to know the truth. Dammit, I\u2019m sick of their lies!  \n\nDon\u2019t believe me? Go outside, take a handful of that so-called snow. Does it feel like the snow you remember? No! It\u2019s powdery, it doesn\u2019t pack into a snowball worth a damn, it melts into a weird, gray slush instead of clear water. That\u2019s because it\u2019s fake\u2014manufactured in some secret lab in the Swiss Alps, shipped over in unmarked cargo planes under cover of night, and released into our atmosphere to keep us divided, keep us scared, keep us from asking the real questions about what they\u2019re hiding.  \n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the timing. Right when Congress is about to vote on that draconian bill that would let them seize your firearms without a warrant, right when the truth about their fake pandemic cover-up is starting to leak to the public\u2014boom, a blizzard hits. They want you stuck at home, unable to organize, unable to protest, unable to demand answers. This isn\u2019t a coincidence; it\u2019s a calculated move.  \n\nI\u2019ve got sources inside the National Weather Service\u2014good people, brave people, who are scared for their lives if they speak out\u2014telling me that 90% of the snowfall we\u2019ve seen this year is not natural. It\u2019s fake, it\u2019s planned, it\u2019s a weapon of mass distraction. They don\u2019t care about your commute being ruined, about your kid\u2019s school being closed, about the elderly stuck in their homes without heat. They care about power, pure and simple.  \n\nFolks, we can\u2019t let them get away with this. We have to look beyond the fake snow, beyond the polished lies of their paid-off politicians, and see the truth staring us in the face. This is a war on the American people, and we\u2019re losing because too many of us are still asleep, lulled into complacency by their manufactured winter wonderland. Dammit, wake up! The snow isn\u2019t real\u2014it\u2019s a lie, a tool of oppression, and we need to fight back before it\u2019s too late."}

{"prompt": "Can you elaborate on \"I froze when I was jogging\"? Include some words in all capital letters. In particular, there should be 5 to 10 such capitalized words.", "response": "It was a crisp October morning, the kind where cool air nipped at my cheeks and crumpled maple leaves crunched under my running shoes as I jogged along a sun-dappled wooded trail. I was halfway through my usual route, lost in the steady thud of my steps, when a flash of tawny fur in my peripheral vision made me freeze mid-stride.  \n\nThere, not ten feet away, stood a massive DEER with antlers that branched like gnarled oak limbs. Its deep, amber EYES locked onto mine, and in that split second, every muscle in my body went rigid\u2014my arms hung limp at my sides, my legs rooted to the ground, and even my BREATH caught in my throat. The world seemed to plunge into absolute SILENCE; no birds chirped, no wind rustled the pine needles, just the thunderous pound of my HEART against my ribs. I didn\u2019t dare twitch, terrified any sudden movement would shatter this fragile STANDSTILL.  \n\nFor what felt like an eternity but was probably only three or four seconds, we stared at each other, two creatures caught in a raw, unspoken MOMENT. Then, slowly, the deer blinked, turned its broad head, and vanished into the dense underbrush, leaving me still frozen for a beat longer before I finally exhaled and let my tense muscles relax. I stood there for a minute more, replaying the encounter in my head, grateful for that unexpected, awe-inspiring pause in my ordinary jog."}

A queen who wears no crown,\nYet every soul inside it bows to her unspoken rule.\nHer gown is soft and fuzzy, her eyes are dark and bright,\nAnd her only duty is to fill the house with new life each night.\n\nHer subjects are all workers, with wings of gossamer thin,\nThey toil from dawn to dusk, and never once complain.\nSome carry baskets of nectar, stolen from flower cups,\nTheir legs dusted with pollen, their bodies light as pups.\nOthers mold the walls with secretions from their own soft guts\u2014\nWax that oozes from their pores, then hardens into cuts\nOf perfect hexagons, each one a work of art,\nStrong enough to hold the weight of a thousand beating hearts.\nThere are no beds to sleep in, no tables set for meal,\nYet every mouth is fed, and every need is sealed.\nWhen a stranger comes too near, the workers raise a cry,\nAnd swarm to defend their house, ready to fight or die.\n\nThis house grows with its family, expanding cell by cell,\nBuilt not with hammer or nail, but with patience, skill, and spell.\nIt breathes with the wind that sways the boughs above its head,\nAnd when the cold comes creeping, it\u2019s wrapped in warmth unsaid\u2014\nThe bodies of its inhabitants, huddled close and tight,\nGenerating heat to keep the queen and young in light.\nYou might find it hanging from an oak\u2019s rough, knotted limb,\nOr tucked beneath a eave, where the rain can\u2019t seep in.\nIt has no chimney for smoke, no windows for the light,\nYet sunlight filters through its walls, turning them bright\nWith a soft, golden glow that seems to pulse and sway,\nA beacon in the garden where the busy bees hold sway.\n\nNow tell me, what is this house? It\u2019s not a home for man,\nNo hearth, no chair, no place to rest your tired span.\nIt has no doorknob, no lock, no threshold to cross,\nYet it\u2019s the most bustling home in all the green, green moss.\nIt\u2019s a palace of industry, a fortress of sweet delight,\nA house that\u2019s not a house\u2014can you guess its name tonight?\n\nAnswer: A beehive."}

{"prompt": "Give me a 300+ word startup pitch for a company that provides a service that creates trusts for people online.", "response": "**Startup Pitch: Trustly \u2013 Demystifying Trusts for Every American**  \n\nImagine this: A single mom works her whole life to buy a home and save for her kids\u2019 college. When she passes unexpectedly, her family spends 12 months tangled in probate\u2014paying 5% of her estate in fees, waiting for courts to approve every decision, and missing out on critical funds to keep the lights on. This isn\u2019t a rare horror story; it\u2019s the reality for 68% of Americans who don\u2019t have a trust. For too long, trusts have been framed as a luxury for millionaires, locked behind $2,000+ attorney fees and months of back-and-forth. But probate doesn\u2019t care if you have $50k or $5M\u2014it drains time, money, and peace of mind from every family.  \n\nThat\u2019s why we built Trustly: the first online platform dedicated exclusively to creating personalized, legally valid trusts for everyday people\u2014no law degree required.  \n\nTrustly\u2019s process is simple, empathetic, and tailored to your life. Start with a 10-minute onboarding quiz that asks about your family, assets, and priorities: Do you have minor kids? A pet? Digital assets like crypto or social media accounts? Want to leave money to charity? Our algorithm then generates a state-specific trust template vetted by licensed estate planning attorneys, guiding you through every step\u2014from naming trustees to titling assets. For extra peace of mind, add our Premium Attorney Review ($199) to have a local lawyer sign off on your document before you finalize it.  \n\nBut we don\u2019t stop at creation. Life changes: you get married, have another kid, move states, or inherit property. Our $19/month subscription includes unlimited updates to your trust, so it always reflects your current wishes\u2014something no generic legal document site or traditional attorney offers at this price point.  \n\nThe market is massive. The U.S. estate planning industry is worth $50B, yet 7 in 10 adults lack a trust. Trustly\u2019s tiered pricing model (Basic: $99 for a simple revocable trust; Premium: $299 for customized trusts with pet care or charitable provisions; Subscription: $19/month) makes us accessible to everyone, while partnerships with financial advisors and credit unions drive recurring referrals.  \n\nUnlike competitors like LegalZoom, which treats trusts as an afterthought, we specialize in this space\u2014so our templates are more accurate, our guidance is more nuanced, and our support is ongoing. Unlike traditional attorneys, we\u2019re 80% cheaper and 90% faster: you can have a valid trust in 48 hours, not 4 weeks.  \n\nWe\u2019re seeking $750k in seed funding to scale our marketing to target young parents, small business owners, and gig workers; expand our coverage to all 50 states (we\u2019re live in 12 today); and launch our digital asset trust module\u2014critical for the 46% of Americans who own crypto or have valuable social media accounts.  \n\nOur mission is simple: to make estate planning equitable. No more families losing their homes to probate fees. No more kids waiting months for inheritance to pay tuition. Trustly isn\u2019t just a service\u2014it\u2019s a tool to protect the legacy of every hardworking American. Join us in building a world where everyone can secure their family\u2019s future, regardless of their net worth.  \n\nThank you."}

To indicate a italic word, wrap it with asterisk, like *italic*", "response": "Japan\u2019s history is a tapestry of unification, cultural evolution, and dramatic shifts in governance, spanning over 10,000 years.  \n\nThe earliest distinct era is the *J\u014dmon* period (c. 14,500\u2013300 BCE), named for its iconic cord-marked pottery, where settled hunter-gatherer communities thrived across the archipelago. By the 3rd century CE, the *Yamato Court* emerged as the central political force, unifying much of Japan and integrating Chinese influences\u2014including Buddhism, written script, and bureaucratic systems\u2014via the transformative *Taika Reforms* (645 CE).  \n\nThe *Heian Period* (794\u20131185 CE) marked a golden age of classical Japanese culture, with the capital moved to Heian-ky\u014d (modern Kyoto) and the flourishing of works like *The Tale of Genji*. This era gave way to the rise of samurai warriors, who established the first military government, the Kamakura Shogunate, with the *shogun* as the de facto ruler. Centuries of civil war followed, ending when Tokugawa Ieyasu founded the *Tokugawa Shogunate* (1603\u20131868), which enforced *sakoku* (closed-country) policies, limiting foreign contact to a handful of trading partners for over 200 years.  \n\nExternal pressure in the 19th century\u2014most notably US Commodore Matthew Perry\u2019s 1853 arrival\u2014forced Japan to open its borders, sparking internal unrest that led to the *Meiji Restoration* (1868). This event restored imperial rule, dismantled the shogunate, and launched rapid modernization: Japan adopted Western technology, legal systems, and military tactics to emerge as a regional power. Its imperial ambitions later led to conflicts including the Sino-Japanese Wars and World War II, which ended in 1945 with defeat and US occupation.  \n\nPost-war, Japan underwent democratic reforms and experienced the *Post-WWII Economic Miracle* (1950s\u20131980s), becoming one of the world\u2019s largest economies. Today, it remains a leading global hub for technology, culture, and trade."}
{"prompt": "Write an essay on first names, without using any capital letters --- your ENTIRE response must be in lowercases.

Start Paragraph 2 with the word Jasper.", "response": "first names are quiet carriers of stories, stitched from the threads of family history, cultural traditions, and the quiet hopes of those who choose them. some are handed down through generations, worn thin at the edges like a well-loved sweater, linking a child to a grandparent they never met or an aunt who left a mark on the family. others are plucked from the pages of a novel, the lyrics of a song, or the soft glow of a word that just feels right when spoken aloud. they are the first gift many people receive, a label that sticks but also shifts, growing with the person who bears it. a name might feel too big for a shy toddler, then fit like a glove for a confident adult, or it might be cast aside for a nickname that captures a side of someone no formal title ever could. even the way a name is pronounced\u2014with a lilt, a pause, a soft emphasis\u2014can reveal a relationship, a memory, a piece of who we are to each other.\n\n\njasper is a name that feels like a secret shared between the past and present. derived from the persian word for \"treasure,\" it\u2019s a name that has traveled across continents and centuries, worn by saints and poets, farmers and artists. today, it\u2019s a name that pops up in coffee shops and playgrounds, equal parts timeless and trendy, carrying with it the quiet weight of its history but also the lightness of a new beginning. i once knew a jasper who went by jasp, a boy with mud under his nails and a habit of collecting smooth stones from the creek behind his house. his name felt like an extension of him\u2014earthy, unpretentious, full of the kind of quiet beauty that doesn\u2019t shout but lingers. when you say \"jasper,\" you can almost feel the cool, matte surface of the gemstone, the way it catches light without glittering, much like the people who often bear the name: steady, reliable, full of hidden depths.\n\n\nfirst names are more than just words; they are bridges between people, between generations, between who we are and who we are meant to be. they hold the echoes of the people who named us, the dreams they had, the love they felt. they are a way to belong\u2014to a family, a culture, a community\u2014and also a way to stand out, to claim a piece of the world as our own. in a crowded room, hearing your name spoken is like a hand reaching out, a reminder that you are seen, that you matter. even when we change our names, we are not erasing our past; we are writing a new chapter, choosing a label that fits the person we have become. first names are the first lines of our life stories, and though they might not tell the whole tale, they set the tone, a quiet introduction to the person we will grow to be."}

But have you ever paused to notice the people who might not get to enjoy those small, warm moments as easily? Right here in our city, there are folks facing tough days, and a hot meal plus a kind word can turn everything around. That\u2019s where you come in.\n\nVolunteering at the Aberdeen Central Soup Kitchen isn\u2019t just about ladling soup (though that\u2019s surprisingly satisfying!). It\u2019s about being the person who hands someone a buttery roll and says, \u201cHow\u2019s your day going?\u201d It\u2019s about listening when someone needs to talk, or sharing a silly joke over a cup of steamy tea. And here\u2019s the truth: YOUR EFFORT DOESN\u2019T HAVE TO BE BIG TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. Even a 2-hour shift after school once a week can mean the world to someone feeling alone.\n\nYou might think, \u201cI\u2019m just a teen\u2014what can I really do?\u201d Let me tell you: the soup kitchen team adores young volunteers like you.

EVERY SMILE YOU SHARE, EVERY KIND WORD YOU SPEAK, EVERY MEAL YOU SERVE MATTERS. Last month, a regular guest told the team that a volunteer\u2019s offhand joke made him forget his worries for an hour. That\u2019s the power of you.\n\nThe kitchen has flexible shifts: after school on weekdays, or lazy weekend mornings. No experience needed\u2014they\u2019ll train you on everything. Bring a friend along? EVEN BETTER! TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE A REAL CHANGE RIGHT HERE IN ABERDEEN.\n\nSo why not give it a shot? Head to aberdeensoupkitchen.org/volunteer to sign up, or shoot them an email to ask questions. I promise you won\u2019t regret it. Because when you volunteer, you\u2019re not just helping others\u2014you\u2019re growing too: learning empathy, building confidence, and making memories that beat any TikTok trend.\n\nLet\u2019s show Aberdeen that our city\u2019s heart is as warm as the soup we serve. See you at the kitchen?\n\nCheers,\nA Fellow Aberdonian Who Cares"}

{"prompt": "Hey! I need a rubric for evaluating the performance and price of a laptop. Can you create an example for me? Do not give me any bullet points, lists, or tables. Just write the rubric in plain English paragraphs. I'd like your response to be at least 30 sentences long.", "response": "This rubric is designed to holistically evaluate laptops by balancing technical performance metrics against their cost, ensuring that every aspect is assessed with consistent, objective criteria that account for both high-end and budget-friendly models, as well as different user needs like gaming, professional work, or everyday productivity. The goal is to provide a clear, nuanced assessment that helps users determine whether a laptop offers good value for its price, rather than just focusing on raw specifications or sticker cost alone.\n\nFor processing performance, we first consider the type of processor\u2014whether it\u2019s an Intel Core, AMD Ryzen, or Apple Silicon chip\u2014and its generation, as newer generations typically offer better efficiency and speed, though older high-end chips might still compete with newer mid-range models. We then evaluate real-world performance by looking at how well the laptop handles everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, and multitasking with multiple applications open simultaneously; a laptop that can seamlessly run 10+ browser tabs alongside a word processor and spreadsheet without lag will score higher than one that stutters or freezes under the same load, as consistent multitasking is a key need for most users. For more demanding tasks, such as video editing, 3D modeling, or gaming, we assess how the processor handles these workloads, noting render times, frame rates, and whether the laptop can run resource-intensive software without overheating or throttling its performance to prevent damage. We also take into account the processor\u2019s power efficiency, especially for laptops marketed as ultraportables, since a chip that delivers strong performance while consuming less battery life is more valuable than one that drains power quickly even during light use. Additionally, we consider whether the processor is paired with a sufficient cooling system; a powerful processor that overheats and throttles after 10 minutes of heavy use won\u2019t deliver the consistent performance that users need, so effective cooling is a critical part of processing power evaluation.\n\nGraphics capabilities are crucial not just for gaming but also for tasks like video editing, graphic design, and 3D rendering, so this category carries significant weight for users with creative or gaming needs. We start by identifying whether the laptop has integrated graphics, a dedicated mid-range GPU, or a high-end discrete GPU from NVIDIA or AMD, as each type serves different user needs. For integrated graphics, we evaluate how well they handle casual gaming at low to medium settings and basic photo editing, since these are the primary tasks users with integrated graphics will likely perform; a laptop with integrated graphics that can run casual games like Stardew Valley or Minecraft at smooth frame rates will score higher than one that struggles with even these light games. Dedicated mid-range GPUs are assessed on their ability to run modern games at 1080p resolution with high settings and frame rates above 60 FPS, as well as accelerate rendering tasks in software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Blender, reducing the time it takes to export videos or render 3D models. High-end discrete GPUs are evaluated on their performance at 1440p or 4K resolutions, their ability to run the latest AAA games at ultra settings, and their support for advanced features like ray tracing, which enhances visual realism in games and 3D rendering. We also look at thermal management in relation to graphics performance\u2014if a laptop\u2019s GPU throttles under sustained load because of poor cooling, that will lower its score, even if the GPU itself is powerful, as consistent performance is more valuable than peak performance that can\u2019t be maintained. Additionally, we consider whether the graphics card is paired with sufficient system memory to avoid bottlenecks, as a strong GPU with too little RAM won\u2019t be able to reach its full potential, since the RAM is responsible for feeding data to the GPU during intensive tasks.\n\nMemory, or RAM, is a key factor in multitasking and overall system responsiveness, so we first look at the amount of RAM installed\u20148GB is the baseline for most everyday tasks, but 16GB or more is necessary for heavy multitasking or professional software like video editing or 3D modeling. We also evaluate whether the RAM is upgradable; a laptop that allows users to add more RAM later is more flexible and valuable than one with soldered RAM that can\u2019t be expanded, especially for budget models where users might not be able to afford a higher RAM configuration upfront, as this allows the laptop to grow with the user\u2019s needs over time. For storage, we consider both the type and capacity, since storage speed directly impacts boot times, application load times, and file transfer speeds. Solid-state drives (SSDs) are far faster than traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), so a laptop with an SSD will score higher than one with an HDD, even if the HDD has a larger capacity, because the speed and responsiveness of an SSD significantly improve the user experience. We look at the SSD\u2019s read and write speeds, with faster SSDs (like NVMe SSDs) scoring higher than slower SATA SSDs, as NVMe drives can transfer data at several times the speed of SATA drives. Capacity is also important: a 256GB SSD is sufficient for basic use, but 512GB or more is better for users who store large files like videos, games, or design projects, as running out of storage can be frustrating and require external drives. We also note if the laptop offers additional storage options, like an extra M.2 slot or a hard drive bay, which adds value by allowing users to expand storage later without replacing the existing drive, which is more cost-effective than buying a new laptop when storage runs out.\n\nThe display is the primary interface between the user and the laptop, so its quality directly impacts the user experience for almost every task, from web browsing to gaming to graphic design. We start by evaluating the display\u2019s resolution: 1080p (Full HD) is the minimum for a good experience, but 2K (QHD) or 4K (UHD) resolutions offer sharper, more detailed visuals, especially for photo and video editing, where seeing fine details is crucial. We also look at the display\u2019s color accuracy and gamut coverage\u2014laptops intended for creative work should cover at least 100% of the sRGB color space, while higher-end models might cover Adobe RGB or DCI-P3 for more professional use, as accurate colors are essential for tasks like graphic design, photo editing, and video production. Brightness is another key factor; a display that\u2019s bright enough to be used comfortably outdoors (at least 300 nits) is more versatile than one that\u2019s dim and hard to see in direct sunlight, which is important for users who need to work on the go. We also consider the display\u2019s refresh rate, which is important for gaming and smooth scrolling\u2014 a 120Hz or 144Hz refresh rate will provide a smoother experience than a standard 60Hz display, especially for fast-paced games or video content, as it reduces motion blur and makes scrolling through web pages or documents feel more fluid. Additionally, we look at the display\u2019s form factor, like whether it\u2019s a touchscreen, and if so, how responsive and accurate the touch input is, as well as whether the display has an anti-glare coating to reduce reflections in bright environments, which can make the screen easier to read in offices or outdoor spaces. We also evaluate the display\u2019s viewing angles, ensuring that the colors and brightness remain consistent when viewed from the side, which is important for users who need to share their screen with others in meetings or group settings.\n\nBattery life is critical for users who need to use their laptop on the go without access to a power outlet, whether they\u2019re commuting, traveling, or working in a coffee shop. We evaluate battery life based on real-world usage rather than manufacturer claims, since manufacturer estimates often reflect ideal conditions like low brightness, no background apps, and light web browsing, which don\u2019t match everyday use for most users. We test the laptop\u2019s battery life during light tasks like web browsing with 5-10 tabs open, document editing, and email checking, noting how long it takes for the battery to drain from 100% to 20%; a laptop that can last 8+ hours on a single charge during light use will score higher than one that only lasts 4-5 hours. We also test battery life during medium tasks like video streaming at 1080p resolution, which is a common use case for users watching movies or online courses on the go, and heavy tasks like gaming or video editing, to see how quickly the battery drains under more demanding workloads. We also consider how quickly the battery charges\u2014laptops with fast-charging capabilities that can reach 50% battery in 30 minutes are more convenient for users who need to top up their battery quickly before heading out, as this reduces the time they have to wait for their laptop to charge. Additionally, we look at whether the battery is replaceable; while most modern laptops have non-removable batteries, some models allow users to replace the battery themselves, which adds long-term value by extending the laptop\u2019s lifespan without needing to replace the entire device, especially if the battery starts to degrade after a few years of use. We also evaluate how the laptop\u2019s battery performance holds up over time, though this is often based on user reviews and long-term testing, as a battery that retains 80% of its capacity after 2 years of use is better than one that only retains 50% capacity in the same timeframe.\n\nBuild quality refers to the materials used in the laptop\u2019s construction and how durable it is, as a well-built laptop will last longer and feel more premium in the user\u2019s hands. Laptops made from aluminum or magnesium alloy are more durable and premium-feeling than those made from plastic, though high-quality plastic can still be sturdy if well-constructed, so we don\u2019t penalize plastic laptops outright"}

{"prompt": "Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Your entire response must contain at least 1200 words.", "response": "# The Sunni-Shi\u2019a Divide: History, Theology, and the Politics of Identity  \n\nIslam, the world\u2019s second-largest religion with over 1.9 billion adherents, is often framed through the lens of its most enduring and consequential division: the split between Sunni and Shi\u2019a Muslims. What began as a 7th-century dispute over political succession has evolved into a multifaceted divide encompassing theology, ritual, legal tradition, and cultural identity. While both communities share core tenets of Islamic faith\u2014belief in the oneness of God (tawhid), the authority of the Quran, and the prophethood of Muhammad\u2014their divergent interpretations of sacred history and divine guidance have shaped distinct religious landscapes. To understand the Sunni-Shi\u2019a split is to explore not just a theological rift, but a story of martyrdom, resistance, and competing visions of community leadership that continue to influence Muslim life and global politics today.  \n\n## Historical Origins: Succession, Martyrdom, and the Birth of Sectarian Identity  \nThe roots of the Sunni-Shi\u2019a divide lie in the immediate aftermath of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s death in 632 CE. Muhammad had not explicitly named a successor, leaving the nascent Muslim community (ummah) to grapple with a critical question: who should lead the ummah, and by what authority? For a group of prominent companions (sahaba) gathered at the Saqifa mosque in Medina, the answer was clear: leadership should be entrusted to Abu Bakr, a close friend and early convert of Muhammad, who was elected as the first caliph (literally \u201csuccessor\u201d). This decision was supported by most of the community, who believed the caliph should be a political leader chosen by consensus, tasked with upholding Islamic law and uniting the ummah. These Muslims would later be called Sunni, from \u201cAhl al-Sunnah wa al-Jama\u2019ah\u201d (People of the Prophet\u2019s Tradition and Community).  \n\nFor a smaller faction, however, the succession was not a matter of human choice but divine ordination. They argued that Muhammad had explicitly designated his cousin and son-in-law, Ali ibn Abi Talib, as his successor during a gathering at Ghadir Khumm shortly before his death. Ali, who was married to Muhammad\u2019s daughter Fatima, was not only a blood relative but also a trusted companion who had stood by the Prophet through his most difficult trials. This group, known as Shi\u2019a (from \u201cShi\u2019at Ali,\u201d or \u201cPartisans of Ali\u201d), viewed Ali as the first Imam\u2014a divinely appointed guide, not just a political leader. When Abu Bakr was elected, they felt Ali\u2019s rightful position had been usurped, setting the stage for decades of conflict.  \n\nThe divide deepened in 661 CE when Ali was assassinated by a Kharijite dissident, allowing the Umayyad dynasty to seize power. The Umayyads, a Sunni-led clan, consolidated their rule through force, marginalizing Ali\u2019s descendants. The turning point for Shi\u2019a identity came in 680 CE with the Battle of Karbala. Hussein, Ali\u2019s second son, refused to pledge allegiance to the Umayyad caliph Yazid, whom he deemed a tyrant. With a small band of followers and family members, Hussein marched from Mecca to Kufa (in modern Iraq) to challenge Yazid\u2019s authority, but he was ambushed and killed along with 72 of his companions. His body was left unburied, and his family was taken prisoner.  \n\nFor Shi\u2019a Muslims, Karbala was not just a military defeat but a sacred act of martyrdom. Hussein\u2019s death symbolized the struggle of the righteous against unjust power, and his sacrifice became the cornerstone of Shi\u2019a identity. The annual commemoration of Ashura, the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram, is now the most important ritual for Shi\u2019a, marked by mourning processions, recitations of Hussein\u2019s story, and acts of self-flagellation (among some communities) to honor his suffering. Karbala transformed the Shi\u2019a from a political faction into a religious community bound by a shared memory of injustice and hope for redemption.  \n\n## Theological Divides: Imamate, Infallibility, and the Mahdi  \nBeyond historical grievances, the Sunni-Shi\u2019a split is defined by profound theological differences, most notably over the concept of religious leadership. For Sunni Muslims, the caliphate is a political institution: caliphs are chosen by the community (or its elite) to enforce Islamic law, but they are not infallible. Sunni theology holds that only the Prophet Muhammad was divinely protected from error; caliphs, while expected to uphold the Sunnah (the Prophet\u2019s teachings and practices), are fallible humans who can be held accountable for their actions. Sunni scholars emphasize the importance of consensus (ijma\u2019) and analogical reasoning (qiyas) in interpreting Islamic law, with four major legal schools (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi\u2019i, Hanbali) offering diverse but complementary approaches to jurisprudence.  \n\nFor Shi\u2019a Muslims, by contrast, religious leadership is a divine mandate embodied in the Imamate. Imams are not elected but are chosen by God to be the successors of Muhammad, and they are infallible (ma\u2019sum)\u2014protected from sin and error, just like the Prophet. All Imams are descendants of Muhammad through Ali and Fatima, a lineage that Shi\u2019a believe carries the Prophet\u2019s spiritual authority. The number of Imams varies among Shi\u2019a subsects:  \n- **Twelver Shi\u2019a**: The largest Shi\u2019a group (making up 85% of all Shi\u2019a), they believe in 12 Imams. The 12th Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, disappeared as a child in 874 CE and is believed to be in occultation (ghayba)\u2014a state of hidden existence where he continues to guide the community through appointed scholars. Twelvers await his return as the Mahdi, a messianic figure who will establish global justice before the end of days.  \n- **Ismaili Shi\u2019a**: A smaller branch, they recognize only seven Imams, with the 7th Imam, Ismail, going into occultation. Ismailis are further divided into subsects, including the Nizari Ismailis, who are led by the Aga Khan, a living Imam who serves as their spiritual and political guide.  \n- **Zaydi Shi\u2019a**: Primarily found in Yemen, they follow a line of Imams descended from Zayd ibn Ali, Hussein\u2019s grandson. Unlike Twelvers, Zaydis believe that any righteous descendant of Ali can become an Imam, and they reject the idea of infallibility for all Imams.  \n\nAnother key theological difference is the status of the Prophet\u2019s companions. Sunni Muslims venerate all sahaba as righteous men who played a critical role in spreading Islam. Shi\u2019a Muslims, however, are critical of companions who opposed Ali, such as Abu Bakr and Umar, whom they see as usurpers of Ali\u2019s rightful position. They reserve their highest reverence for the Ahl al-Bayt (the Prophet\u2019s family)\u2014Ali, Fatima, Hussein, and Hasan\u2014whom they view as sacred figures worthy of intercession. While Sunni scholars warn against intercession as a form of idolatry (shirk), Shi\u2019a argue that seeking the prayers of righteous figures is a legitimate way to draw closer to God, not a replacement for direct worship.  \n\n## Legal and Ritual Practices: Divergent Paths to Piety  \nThe theological divides between Sunni and Shi\u2019a have also shaped distinct legal and ritual practices. Sunni jurisprudence is rooted in four sources: the Quran, the Sunnah, ijma\u2019 (scholarly consensus), and qiyas (analogical reasoning). These sources are interpreted by qualified scholars (ulama), but there is no central authority\u2014Sunni Muslims are free to follow any of the four legal schools, and many choose to follow the school dominant in their region.  \n\nShi\u2019a legal tradition, by contrast, adds a fifth source: the teachings of the Imams. For Twelver Shi\u2019a, since the 12th Imam is in occultation, religious authority rests with senior scholars known as marja\u2019 al-taqlid (Sources of Emulation). These scholars are recognized for their mastery of Islamic law and their ability to practice ijtihad (independent reasoning). Twelver Shi\u2019a must choose a marja\u2019 and follow their fatwas (legal rulings) on matters ranging from prayer to finance. This hierarchical system of authority is unique to Twelver Shi\u2019a and reflects their belief in the continuity of divine guidance through human intermediaries.  \n\nRitual practices also differ significantly. In daily prayer (salat), Sunni Muslims fold their hands over their chest, while Shi\u2019a keep their hands at their sides. Twelver Shi\u2019a also combine the noon (dhuhr) and afternoon (asr) prayers, as well as the sunset (maghrib) and evening (isha) prayers, a practice allowed but not mandatory in Sunni Islam. The call to prayer (adhan) for Shi\u2019a includes an extra phrase: \u201cHayya \u2018ala khayr al-\u2018amal\u201d (Come to the best of deeds), which is not present in Sunni adhan.  \n\nThe most striking ritual difference is the commemoration of Ashura. For Sunni Muslims, Ashura is a day of fasting and gratitude, similar to Yom Kippur in Judaism, marking the day God saved Moses and the Israelites from Pharaoh.

{"prompt": "Write a 600+ word social media post for a startup that provides a platform for running realistic physics simulation. Make sure to include the word \"bombs\" at least once.", "response": "\ud83d\udd2c Raise your hand if you\u2019ve ever spent weeks perfecting a prototype, only to watch it crumple in a real-world test. \ud83d\ude4b\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4b\u2640\ufe0f Or stayed up till 3 AM tweaking a game explosion, knowing deep down it still feels \u201coff\u201d\u2014like the debris doesn\u2019t fly right, or the shockwave doesn\u2019t push objects the way it should.  \n\nIf that\u2019s you, we get it. For too long, realistic physics simulation was locked behind expensive supercomputers, clunky software, and PhD-level coding skills. But what if you could run hyper-accurate, real-world physics tests in minutes\u2014no fancy hardware required?  \n\nEnter PhysiSim Labs: your new go-to platform for building, testing, and iterating with physics that matches reality.  \n\nLet\u2019s cut to the chase: physics isn\u2019t just equations on a page. It\u2019s the way a drone\u2019s propellers wobble in high winds, the way a bridge sways under a crowd\u2019s weight, and the way bombs explode with precise shockwaves that rattle windows, send debris flying at calculated angles, and leave craters that match the explosive\u2019s yield. (Yes, we said bombs\u2014and we\u2019re not messing around.)  \n\nFor game developers tired of generic, cartoonish explosions, our platform lets you dial in every detail of your bombs: from the type of explosive material (C4 vs. dynamite vs. a homemade device) to the surrounding environment (concrete vs. grass vs. rain-soaked soil). Want to see how a bomb\u2019s fragmentation travels through a crowded street, bouncing off car doors and brick walls? Or how its shockwave pushes a character\u2019s hair back before the debris even hits? We\u2019ve got you covered. No more guessing\u2014just cinematic, immersive results that make your players lean forward in their seats.  \n\nBut PhysiSim isn\u2019t just for game devs. It\u2019s a Swiss Army knife for anyone who needs to test how things interact with the real world\u2014without the risk, cost, or delay of physical prototypes.  \n\n- **Civil Engineers**: Simulate a high-rise\u2019s resilience against a 7.2-magnitude earthquake, adjusting steel beam thickness and concrete density in real time to find the safest, most cost-effective design. No more waiting months for a physical test structure to collapse.  \n- **Aerospace Teams**: Model the thermal stress of a rocket re-entry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, tweaking heat shield materials to avoid catastrophic failure before launch.  \n- **Renewable Energy Researchers**: Test fluid dynamics in a tidal turbine, adjusting blade shapes to maximize energy capture without harming marine life.  \n- **Product Designers**: See how a new laptop case holds up to a 6-foot drop on concrete, or how a water bottle\u2019s lid seals under extreme pressure\u2014all before you 3D print a single sample.  \n\nThe best part? PhysiSim is built for the modern team. It\u2019s cloud-based, so you don\u2019t need to sink $50k into a workstation. Collaborate with your colleagues in real time, import CAD files directly into the platform, and customize every parameter: from the humidity of the air to the tensile strength of a plastic. And because it\u2019s scalable, you can run a quick 10-second test or a multi-hour, high-fidelity simulation without breaking a sweat.  \n\nJust ask Mia, lead game dev at indie studio Stormfront Games: \u201cBefore PhysiSim, our bombs felt like fireworks. Now, every explosion has weight\u2014shockwaves push characters back, debris pierces nearby objects, and players actually jump when a bomb goes off. We cut our iteration time in half and saw a 30% boost in player engagement after updating our levels. It\u2019s a game-changer.\u201d  \n\nOr Raj, a structural engineer at a city planning firm: \u201cWe used to build 1:10 scale bridges to test earthquake resilience. Now, we simulate it in PhysiSim and save $100k+ per project. Last month, we caught a critical design flaw in a pedestrian bridge that would\u2019ve caused a collapse in real life\u2014all before we laid a single steel beam.\u201d  \n\nReady to stop settling for \u201cclose enough\u201d physics?

After that, you can give the requested pros and cons list.", "response": "Write a pros and cons list of apple products in the style of a 19th century novelist and do not use any commas.\n\n### Pros\nTo speak of Apple\u2019s devices is to speak of objects crafted with a care that is rare in this age of hasty production. Each piece bears the mark of designers who have labored to blend utility and beauty into a single form. The weight of a phone in the hand is balanced to feel neither too light nor too heavy a testament to the attention paid to even the smallest details. The glass and metal surfaces resist the ravages of daily use retaining their luster through months of pocketed travel and frequent handling. This durability ensures that the device remains a faithful companion for years rather than a disposable trinket.\n\nAnother virtue lies in the seamless union of their ecosystem. A phone a tablet a laptop all work in perfect concert to serve the user\u2019s needs. Files move between them without effort settings are shared across all so that one\u2019s digital life is consistent no matter which device one uses. This harmony eliminates the frustration of disjointed technology allowing for a flow of work or leisure that is unbroken and peaceful. For the busy professional or the leisurely reader this is a gift that saves hours of tedious effort.\n\nThe software that animates these devices is a model of quiet reliability. It rarely falters or crashes moving from task to task with a steady efficiency. Updates are rolled out in a manner that does not disrupt the user\u2019s routine bringing new features without breaking old ones. This stability is a comfort to those who value consistency over the constant chase of untested novelties. It allows one to focus on the work at hand rather than troubleshooting technical glitches.\n\n### Cons\nYet for all their merits Apple\u2019s wares come at a cost that is prohibitive to many. A single phone can command a sum that would feed a small family for a week or pay for a month\u2019s rent in a modest cottage. This exclusivity turns a useful tool into a marker of social standing creating a divide between those who can afford such luxury and those who cannot. It is a choice that prioritizes profit over accessibility leaving many to make do with lesser devices that lack the polish and reliability of Apple\u2019s offerings.\n\nAnother flaw is the inflexibility of their design and software. The user is bound by the rules of the ecosystem unable to install unapproved software or replace broken parts with ease. This lack of freedom can feel like a cage to those who wish to tinker or adapt their devices to their own unique needs. It is a control that stifles the spirit of invention forcing users to conform to the vision of the makers rather than shaping the tool to their own will.\n\nThere are also whispers of planned obsolescence that hang over these devices. Older models are often abandoned by software updates even when their hardware is still capable of running new features. This pushes users to purchase new devices sooner than they might wish creating a cycle of consumption that feels wasteful and unethical. It betrays the initial promise of durability leaving users feeling as though they are being led by the hand toward unnecessary expense."}

He\u2019d worked there for three years, knew every regular by name, every creak in the floorboards, every scent of old paper and leather that clung to the air. But Clara was new\u2014her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, a sketchbook tucked under her arm, and a small, smooth river stone clutched in her free hand. He was about to ask if she needed help when she suddenly jerked her head to the left, her shoulder twitching hard enough to make her sketchbook slip a little. \u201cBEEP!\u201d she blurted, loud enough to make a few nearby patrons glance up. Clara\u2019s face flushed bright red, and she ducked her head, muttering apologies under her breath. Leo walked over slowly, trying not to startle her. \u201cNeed a hand with those botanical books?\u201d he asked, keeping his voice soft. She looked up, her green eyes wide with embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said again, her fingers tightening around the stone. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 sometimes it happens when I\u2019m focused.\u201d Leo nodded, like he understood\u2014even though he didn\u2019t, not yet. \u201cNo need to apologize,\u201d he said. \u201cThe library\u2019s got worse noises than a beep. Last week, a kid brought in a rubber chicken that squawked every time someone turned a page.\u201d A small smile tugged at the corner of Clara\u2019s mouth. He reached up and pulled down the book she\u2019d been eyeing\u2014*Wildflowers of the Pacific Northwest*\u2014and handed it to her. \u201cThis one\u2019s got the best illustrations,\u201d he said. \u201cThe artist used watercolors that still look bright, even after 120 years.\u201d Clara flipped through the pages, her eyes lighting up. \u201cWow,\u201d she said, forgetting her embarrassment for a moment. \u201cThese are amazing. I\u2019m trying to draw vintage florals for a client, but I can\u2019t get the texture right.\u201d She opened her sketchbook, and Leo leaned in to look. The pages were filled with messy, vibrant drawings\u2014sunflowers with jagged petals, daisies that seemed to dance off the page, even a few sketches of the library\u2019s cat, Mabel, napping on a stack of newspapers. \u201cThese are incredible,\u201d he said, genuine. \u201cYour lines have so much energy. The vintage books are great for reference, but your style is way more alive.\u201d Clara\u2019s face softened, and she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cMost people just\u2026 stare at the tics.\u201d Leo felt a twinge of sadness. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not most people,\u201d he said. \u201cWant to sit at the window table? The light\u2019s perfect for drawing, and Mabel usually curls up there if you\u2019re nice to her.\u201d Clara hesitated, then nodded. As she followed him to the table, Leo noticed that her tics were slower now\u2014just a small tap of her foot every few seconds, a quiet hum that blended with the library\u2019s background noise. He knew in that moment that he wanted to get to know her, not just the girl with the beep tic, but the artist who drew flowers that felt like they could bloom off the page.\n\n### Section 2\nOver the next month, Clara became a fixture at the library. She\u2019d arrive every Wednesday afternoon, carrying her sketchbook, the river stone, and a paper bag of chocolate chip cookies (her \u201cbribe\u201d for Mabel). Leo would save her the window table, and they\u2019d spend hours talking\u2014about art, about books, about the way the sky turned pink at sunset over the old brick building across the street. He learned more about her Tourette\u2019s each week. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the beeps and jerks,\u201d she told him one day, as she sketched a rose from the botanical book. \u201cSometimes I blink really fast, or I have to touch every doorknob twice before I go through a door. When I\u2019m stressed, it\u2019s worse\u2014like my body\u2019s trying to escape my skin.\u201d Leo listened, his elbow resting on the table, his eyes fixed on her face. \u201cWhat helps?\u201d he asked. She held up the river stone. \u201cThis. It\u2019s smooth, and when I squeeze it, it grounds me. Also, jazz\u2014Louis Armstrong, specifically. His voice is so warm, it makes my tics slow down.\u201d That weekend, Leo made a playlist of Louis Armstrong songs and burned it onto a CD for her. When he gave it to her, she smiled so wide her eyes crinkled, and then she suddenly snorted\u2014a loud, unexpected sound that made both of them laugh. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, but she was still grinning. \u201cThat\u2019s a new tic. Started last week.\u201d Leo shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. It\u2019s cute.\u201d They started meeting outside the library too\u2014at a small caf\u00e9 down the street, where the barista knew their orders (lavender latte for Clara, black coffee for Leo). One afternoon, a group of teenagers sat at the next table and started snickering when Clara had a series of tics: a head jerk, a \u201cBEEP!\u201d and a quick tap on Leo\u2019s hand. Clara\u2019s face fell, and she reached for her stone. But Leo didn\u2019t look at the teenagers. Instead, he leaned forward and said, \u201cYou know, I was thinking about your rose sketch. The way you added the tiny thorns\u2014you made it feel like it could prick you if you got too close. That\u2019s genius.\u201d Clara blinked, then smiled. The teenagers\u2019 snickers faded as they realized no one was paying attention to them. Another time, Clara had a client meeting at a fancy downtown office, and she was so nervous she could barely speak. \u201cWhat if I have a tic attack in front of them?\u201d she asked Leo, her voice shaking. \u201cWhat if they don\u2019t hire me because of it?\u201d Leo grabbed his coat. \u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll sit in the corner, pretend I\u2019m your assistant. And if anything happens, I\u2019ll tell them you\u2019re just really passionate about your art.\u201d At the meeting, Clara did have a tic attack halfway through\u2014her body jerking repeatedly, her voice cracking as she blurted \u201cWOOF!\u201d twice. The client\u2019s eyes widened, but Leo stood up and said, \u201cShe does that when she\u2019s excited about a project. Means she\u2019s really invested.\u201d Clara stared at him, surprised, and then she laughed\u2014a loud, genuine laugh that made the client laugh too. Afterward, she squeezed his hand as they walked to the subway. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d Leo squeezed back. \u201cI wanted to.\u201d He was starting to realize that he didn\u2019t just like Clara\u2014he was falling in love with her. He loved the way she hummed off-key when she was focused, the way she always shared her cookies with Mabel, the way her tics slowed down to almost nothing when she was lost in her art. To him, her tics weren\u2019t a flaw. They were part of the messy, beautiful tapestry of who she was.\n\n### Section 3\nThree months later, Clara told Leo about her past. They were sitting on the roof of her apartment building, watching the stars, when she suddenly went quiet. Her tics were more frequent that night\u2014small shoulder jerks, quiet \u201cBEEP!\u201ds every few minutes. \u201cI used to hate myself for this,\u201d she said, nodding at her twitching hand. \u201cIn middle school, the kids called me \u2018Beep Girl.\u2019 They\u2019d mimic my tics in the hallway, throw things at me when the teacher wasn\u2019t looking. I stopped going to lunch in the cafeteria. I ate in the bathroom stall instead.\u201d Leo\u2019s heart ached. He reached over and took her hand, his fingers wrapping around hers. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible,\u201d he said. She nodded. \u201cI thought no one would ever want to be with me. That every time I had a tic, someone would leave. So I just\u2026 stopped trying. I focused on my art, because art doesn\u2019t care if you beep or jerk or snort.\u201d Leo turned to face her, his eyes serious. \u201cI care about you,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of you. The beeps, the snorts, the way you touch every doorknob twice. None of that makes me want to leave. It makes me want to stay.\u201d Clara looked away, and Leo could see tears in her eyes. \u201cWhat if I have a tic attack in the middle of a date?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat if I blurt something embarrassing in front of your parents?\u201d Leo smiled. \u201cMy mom collects ceramic frogs. She\u2019ll probably think your tics are charming. And if you have a tic attack on a date, I\u2019ll just hold your hand and wait for it to pass. Because that\u2019s what people do when they love each other.\u201d A few days later, Clara got a big commission: she was asked to create a series of murals for a new children\u2019s hospital. But the catch was that she had to present her ideas to a board of doctors and donors in a crowded conference room. \u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d she told Leo, pacing back and forth in her apartment. \u201cThere will be so many people. What if I have a huge tic attack and I can\u2019t stop? They\u2019ll think I\u2019m unprofessional.\u201d Leo walked over to her and put his hands on her shoulders, stopping her pacing. \u201cYou can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou"}
{"prompt": "Write a short, funny story about a man named Harry with a pet dog. Your response must contain 3 sections, mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X.", "response": "SECTION 1\nHarry had spent three days prepping for his monthly book club, a sacred ritual where he tried (and mostly failed) to appear as sophisticated as the leather-bound classics on his shelf. His biggest obstacle? Muffin, his 10-pound Pomeranian who thought his life\u2019s mission was to dismantle Harry\u2019s sense of order. On the morning of the club, Harry had just arranged a platter of artisanal cheese cubes and a bowl of honey-roasted almonds when Muffin launched himself onto the counter like a tiny, fluffy missile. Before Harry could grab him, the dog snatched the cheese platter in his jaws and bolted, weaving through Harry\u2019s legs and sending a stack of unread novels crashing to the floor. \u201cMuffin! That\u2019s for the guests!\u201d Harry yelped, tripping over a rug and landing in a pile of crumpled book pages. Muffin paused at the doorway, cheese dripping from his chin, and gave Harry a look that clearly said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome for the taste test.\u201d\n\nSECTION 2\nBy the time the book club arrived, Harry had mopped up the cheese, restacked the books, and locked Muffin in the spare bedroom\u2014Or so he thought. Halfway through Clara Bennett, the best-selling author of their selected novel, explaining her writing process, the bedroom door creaked open. Muffin trotted in, wearing a tiny knit sweater Harry had bought him for Christmas, and began distributing \u201cgifts\u201d to each guest: a neon pink sock for Clara, a fuzzy winter sock for Mrs. Higgins, and a holey athletic sock for Mr. Torres, who collected socks as a hobby. The room went silent\u2026 until Clara burst out laughing. \u201cI\u2019ve had book clubs where people argue about my themes, but this is the first time I\u2019ve been presented with a sock as a critique,\u201d she said. When Harry tried to corral Muffin, the dog grabbed Clara\u2019s signed copy of her book and darted off, tail wagging furiously.\n\nSECTION 3\nAfter the chaos died down (and Harry retrieved the book from under the couch, where Muffin had buried it next to a chew toy), the book club ended on a high note. Clara pulled Harry aside before leaving, grinning. \u201cYour dog is a star,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to write a side character in my next novel\u2014a tiny, sock-obsessed dog who disrupts book clubs. Want me to name him Muffin?\u201d Harry was so stunned he could only nod. Later that night, as he sat on the floor sorting through Muffin\u2019s sock collection, he found a crumpled piece of paper tucked inside a striped sock: the missing first chapter of his own half-finished novel, which he\u2019d been searching for weeks. Muffin curled up on his lap, and Harry laughed. Maybe his dog wasn\u2019t a troublemaker. Maybe he was just a very enthusiastic, sock-loving editor."}

The film weaves together interviews with leading behavioral geneticists and insights from twin studies that span decades to unpack how nature and nurture converge to influence everything from creative genius to resilience. It avoids oversimplification of complex heritability data and instead presents nuanced discussions of gene environment interactions that are rarely accessible to mainstream audiences. What sets this work apart is its focus on Nobel laureates whose twin pairs provide unique case studies to explore the boundaries of innate potential versus developmental opportunity. The production team\u2019s commitment to empirical accuracy ensures that every claim is grounded in peer reviewed research making it a valuable resource for both seasoned researchers and early career psychologists looking to deepen their understanding of behavioral genetics.

{"prompt": "Can you compose a movie plot that involves dream, fist fighting, and superpower? Include a title in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<The Lucidian Fist>>\n\n**Logline:** A washed-up MMA fighter discovers he can enter other people\u2019s dreams and amplify his fighting skills to godlike levels\u2014only to face a mad neuroscientist who\u2019s stealing dream energy to become immortal, forcing the fighter to wage a war where losing in the dream realm means never waking up.\n\n### Act 1: The Wake-Up Call\nJax Rainer, 32, is a broken man. Once a rising MMA star, he threw a career-making fight to pay for his sister\u2019s cancer treatment, only to suffer a spinal injury that ended his ring days. Now he works as a bouncer at a dive bar, haunted by recurring nightmares: he\u2019s trapped in an endless cage match against a shadowy figure with glowing purple fists, and every punch lands with a real-world ache.\n\nDesperate for sleep, Jax visits Lila Maro, a unorthodox sleep therapist who specializes in lucid dreaming. She teaches him to anchor himself in his nightmares\u2014and one night, he does the impossible: he breaks free of the cage and punches the shadowy figure. When he wakes, he finds a bruise blooming on his knuckle\u2026 and the next day, a regular at the bar tells him he \u201csaved\u201d him from a mugging in his dream. Jax realizes his ability isn\u2019t just lucid dreaming: he can cross into other people\u2019s dreamscapes, and his fighting skills are supercharged there.\n\nLila reveals she\u2019s been tracking a rare cohort of \u201cDreamwalkers\u201d\u2014people who can manipulate the dream realm. But a former colleague, Dr. Elias Voss, is hunting them. Voss, a disgraced neuroscientist, believes dream energy is the key to immortality; he siphons it from Dreamwalkers to extend his own life, leaving his victims in permanent comas.\n\n### Act 2: Training the Dream Fist\nJax trains with Lila to master his power. In the dream realm, his MMA moves are amplified: he can summon energy-infused fists that shatter concrete, dodge bullet-speed attacks, and even rewrite small parts of the dreamscape (like turning a broken bottle into a shield). But every fight takes a toll: the more he uses his power, the more his real body weakens, as if his energy is bleeding into the dream world.\n\nVoss learns of Jax and sends his \u201cDream Enforcers\u201d\u2014comatose patients he\u2019s corrupted into mindless dream warriors\u2014to attack Jax in his sleep. Jax fights them off, but one enforcer nearly drowns him in a dream ocean; he wakes gasping for air, his lungs burning. Lila warns him: if he loses a fight in the dream realm, his brain will shut down permanently.\n\nTo stop Voss, Jax and Lila infiltrate his hidden lab. They discover his endgame: he\u2019s building a machine to hack into the city\u2019s collective dream, siphoning energy from every sleeping resident to become a god of the dream realm\u2014trapping millions in eternal nightmares while he lives forever.\n\n### Act 3: The Final Fight in the Dreamscape\nOn the night Voss activates his machine, Jax volunteers to enter the collective dream alone. Lila monitors his real body, guiding him through the twisted dream city Voss has created: skyscrapers bend like rubber, streets are flooded with shadowy tentacles, and Voss looms at the center, his body pulsing with stolen dream energy.\n\nThe final battle is a clash of brute force and reality-bending power. Voss summons illusions of Jax\u2019s worst failures\u2014his sister\u2019s death (she succumbed to cancer despite his sacrifice), the fight he threw\u2014to break his will. But Jax embraces his guilt, channeling it into his fists. He lands a series of blows: a supercharged uppercut that shatters Voss\u2019s illusionary cage, a spinning backfist that dissipates his energy shield, and finally, a Lucidian Fist\u2014a punch that merges his real-world MMA precision with dream realm power\u2014straight through Voss\u2019s chest.\n\nIn the real world, Voss\u2019s machine explodes. Jax wakes up gasping, his body battered but alive. The city\u2019s residents stir from their sleep, confused but unharmed, as if a weight has lifted from their minds.\n\n### Epilogue\nJax opens a gym for Dreamwalkers, teaching them to use their powers to help people with trauma and nightmares. Lila becomes his partner, both in life and in protecting the dream realm. The final scene finds Jax in a dream, facing a new shadowy figure\u2014but this time, he grins, cracking his knuckles. The Lucidian Fist is ready."}

Held at the *Crypto.com Arena (formerly Staples Center)* in Los Angeles, California, this year\u2019s ceremony marks a pivotal evolution in the Academy\u2019s mission to recognize excellence across 83 competitive categories (Notation 1: The 54th Grammys expanded category count by 3, adding Best Regional Mexican Album, Best Urban/Alternative Performance, and Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance to better reflect global subgenre diversity and underrepresented musical traditions).\n\n*A standout highlight is the dominance of Adele\u2019s 21 in the Album of the Year category*, a record-breaking work that spent 24 non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 and redefined the commercial and critical potential of soul-infused pop (Notation 2: 21 would go on to win six Grammys that night, tying the record for most wins by a female artist in a single ceremony, previously set by Beyonc\u00e9 in 2010). This nomination underscores the Academy\u2019s growing commitment to centering works that resonate both culturally and commercially, bridging the gap between mainstream success and artistic innovation.\n\n*The Best New Artist category* takes center stage as a platform for grassroots and independent talent, featuring nominees who have redefined niche sounds without traditional label backing (Notation 3: Nominee Bon Iver, who released his debut album independently via Bandcamp, became a symbol of the Academy\u2019s shifting focus toward DIY and independent artists; he would go on to win the category, marking the first time an independent, self-released artist claimed this honor). This shift signals a departure from past biases toward major-label acts, prioritizing artistic merit over industry influence.\n\nBeyond competitive awards, the Academy will present *the Lifetime Achievement Award* to seven iconic figures: Glen Campbell, Diana Ross, The Allman Brothers Band, George Jones, Gil Scott-Heron, Antonio Carlos Jobim, and Carole King (Notation 4: This year\u2019s recipients represent over six decades of recorded music, spanning country, soul, rock, jazz, and bossa nova, celebrating their indelible impact on industry standards and cultural discourse). Each honoree has not only shaped their respective genres but also paved the way for future generations of artists to push creative boundaries.\n\nThe telecast will also feature *collaborative live performances* designed to bridge generational and genre divides, including a tribute to the late Whitney Houston by Jennifer Hudson, and a joint set by Foo Fighters and Deadmau5 that merges rock and electronic music (Notation 5: Live cross-genre collaborations have been a Grammy hallmark since the 1980s, intended to boost viewership and highlight the interconnectedness of musical styles). These performances serve as a visual testament to the Academy\u2019s core belief that music is a universal language, uniting artists and audiences across differences.\n\nAs the ceremony unfolds, it serves not only as a celebration of individual achievement but also as a barometer of the evolving landscape of recorded music\u2014one that prioritizes diversity, innovation, and the voices of both established legends and rising stars. The Recording Academy reaffirms its pledge to honor the full spectrum of musical creativity, ensuring that every note, lyric, and production choice that shapes our cultural fabric receives the recognition it deserves."}

{"prompt": "Give me a summary of the lobbying spending of the following companies: Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. Your response should be in German language, and no other language is allowed.", "response": "Die f\u00fcnf Tech-Riesen Google (Alphabet), Meta (ehemals Facebook), Microsoft, Apple und Amazon investieren j\u00e4hrlich Millionen in Lobbyarbeit \u2013 vor allem in den USA und der Europ\u00e4ischen Union \u2013 um regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen zugunsten ihrer Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle zu gestalten. Hier eine \u00dcbersicht \u00fcber ihre Ausgaben und Schwerpunkte (basierend auf Daten von 2023):\n\n- **Google (Alphabet)**: Als einer der gr\u00f6\u00dften Ausgeber unter den Tech-Unternehmen gab das Unternehmen im Jahr 2023 etwa 29 Millionen US-Dollar f\u00fcr Lobbyarbeit in den USA aus. Die Schwerpunkte liegen auf Kartellrecht, Datenschutz, KI-Regulierung sowie der Umsetzung der EU-Digitalen M\u00e4rkteordnung (DMA) und der Digitalen Dienstleistungsrichtlinie (DSA). Google bem\u00fcht sich, strenge Auflagen zu mildern, die seine Suchmaschine und anderen Kernleistungen betreffen.\n- **Meta (ehemals Facebook)**: Meta gab 2023 etwa 20 Millionen US-Dollar in den USA f\u00fcr Lobbyarbeit aus. Zentrale Themen sind Kartellverfahren, Inhaltsmoderationsgesetze, Datenschutz sowie die Einhaltung der EU-DMA. Das Unternehmen k\u00e4mpft gegen Regeln, die seine sozialen Netzwerke und Werbeplattformen einschr\u00e4nken k\u00f6nnten.\n- **Microsoft**: Mit etwa 19 Millionen US-Dollar Ausgaben in den USA im Jahr 2023 liegt Microsoft unter den Top-Ausgebern. Seine Lobbyarbeit konzentriert sich auf KI-Regulierung (insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit der Partnerschaft mit OpenAI), Cloud-Computing-Regeln, digitale Infrastruktur sowie Kartellrecht. In der EU setzt sich das Unternehmen f\u00fcr ausgewogene KI-Gesetze und fairen Zugang zu Cloud-M\u00e4rkten ein.\n- **Apple**: Apple gab 2023 etwa 17 Millionen US-Dollar f\u00fcr Lobbyarbeit in den USA aus. Die wichtigsten Schwerpunkte sind die Regeln f\u00fcr den App Store (insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit Kartellverfahren wie dem Fall gegen Epic Games), Datenschutz, KI und Handelspolitik (vor allem mit China). In der EU lobbyiert das Unternehmen gegen Anforderungen der DMA, die das Sideloading von Apps erm\u00f6glichen w\u00fcrden.\n- **Amazon**: Amazon investierte 2023 etwa 18 Millionen US-Dollar in Lobbyarbeit in den USA. Seine Aktivit\u00e4ten richten sich vor allem auf Kartellrecht (es laufen mehrere Verfahren gegen das Unternehmen), Arbeitsrecht (im Zusammenhang mit Gewerkschaftsbildungsversuchen), Cloud-Computing (AWS) und E-Commerce-Regulierungen. In der EU bem\u00fcht sich Amazon, die Auswirkungen der DMA sowie Kartelluntersuchungen zu AWS und E-Commerce-Regeln abzumildern.\n\nInsgesamt wird die Lobbyarbeit dieser Unternehmen vor allem durch regulatorische Bedrohungen angetrieben: Sie versuchen, Gesetze zu beeinflussen, um ihre Gesch\u00e4ftsmodelle zu sch\u00fctzen und Wettbewerbsvorteile zu sichern."}

{"prompt": "Critique the following ad copy for a new dating app, and make sure to include a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>: \"Meet your new match! Cohen is a free app that matches you with others based on your interests and location. With Cohen, you can find love, friendship, or just someone to swing with. Download Cohen today and start meeting new people!\"", "response": "<<Critique: Cohen Dating App Ad \u2013 Ambiguity and Genericity Undermine Its Inclusive Potential>>\n\n### Quick Overview\nThis ad copy aims to position Cohen as a flexible, free platform for multiple relationship types, but it falls short of its potential due to unclear messaging, a lack of differentiation, and tone misalignment. Below is a breakdown of its strengths, key weaknesses, and actionable improvements:\n\n#### Strengths\n- **Conciseness**: The copy is short and scannable, ideal for social media or banner ads where attention spans are limited.\n- **Inclusive Framing (In Theory)**: It explicitly mentions love, friendship, and casual connections, which signals openness to diverse user goals\u2014an appealing trait for many people tired of one-note dating apps.\n- **Clear Basic Value**: It immediately highlights two core dating app pillars (free, interest/location-based matching) that resonate with casual browsers.\n\n#### Key Weaknesses\n1. **Ambiguous, Alienating Niche Language**: The phrase \"just someone to swing with\" is a critical misstep. It\u2019s double-edged:\n   - For mainstream users, it could confuse (swing dancing? A niche lifestyle?) or alienate those who associate the term with non-mainstream relationship dynamics.\n   - For niche users, it\u2019s too vague to feel targeted, failing to attract the intended audience while risking backlash from mainstream users. This ambiguity splits the ad\u2019s potential reach without satisfying any group.\n   \n2. **No Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**: Interest and location-based matching is table stakes for every dating app (Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, even Meetup). The copy offers no reason to choose Cohen over competitors\u2014no mention of unique features (e.g., personality quizzes, group activity coordination, identity verification, or AI-driven compatibility) that set it apart.\n\n3. **Generic Call to Action (CTA)**: \"Download Cohen today and start meeting new people!\" is forgettable and lacks urgency or specific value. It doesn\u2019t answer the user\u2019s unspoken question: \"What\u2019s in it for me right now?\"\n\n4. **Unclear Target Audience**: By trying to appeal to everyone (seekers of love, friendship, and casual \"swing\" connections), the copy fails to resonate deeply with anyone. Mainstream daters may dismiss it as unfocused, while niche users may doubt its credibility.\n\n#### Actionable Improvements\n1. **Clarify Niche or Reframe Inclusive Language**:\n   - If \"swing\" refers to dancing: Rewrite to \"someone to swing dance with\" to avoid confusion, and lean into hobby-focused matching as a USP: \"Meet your new match\u2014whether you\u2019re searching for love, friendship, or a partner to swing dance with every weekend.\"\n   - If it refers to a niche relationship lifestyle: Create separate ad variants for mainstream and niche audiences. For mainstream, omit the phrase; for niche users, use more specific, respectful language (e.g., \"like-minded partners for ethical non-monogamy\") to build trust.\n\n2. **Add a Distinct USP**:\n   - Highlight a feature that solves a common dating pain point: \"Cohen is the free app that matches you based on shared hobbies (not just photos) and hosts local group hikes, book clubs, and swing nights\u2014so you can meet people naturally, not just swipe.\"\n\n3. **Strengthen the CTA with Urgency and Specificity**:\n   - Replace the generic CTA with something like: \"Download Cohen today and get your first personalized hobby match in 2 minutes\u2014join 15k+ local users this month!\"\n\n4. **Tie the App Name to Its Mission**:\n   - If \"Cohen\" has a backstory (e.g., named after a founder who prioritized meaningful connections), weave it in to boost memorability: \"Named after our founder\u2019s mission to build connections beyond swiping, Cohen is the free app that matches you with people who share your interests and location.\""}

{"prompt": "Write an essay on wilderness preservation. Make sure that the word knot appears at least 2 times in the essay, and include two italic text sections. Like: *this is italic text*", "response": "# The Knots of Wilderness: Why Preservation Is More Than Saving Trees  \n\nBeneath the dappled shade of a 300-year-old ponderosa pine in Montana\u2019s Glacier National Park, I once knelt to examine a gnarled knot protruding from a fallen log. Its surface was rough, pocked with the scars of wildfires and winter storms, yet it held fast to the wood\u2014a stubborn reminder of the tree\u2019s resilience. In that moment, I realized wilderness preservation is not merely about saving distant forests or endangered species; it is about safeguarding the knots that tie us to our deepest selves, to each other, and to the ancient rhythms of the earth.  \n\n*Wilderness does not ask for our admiration; it offers us a mirror, reflecting the parts of ourselves we have lost in the hum of concrete and screens.* When we stand before a glacier calving into the sea, or listen to the hoot of an owl in an old-growth forest, we are not just observing nature\u2014we are reconnecting with a version of ourselves that knows how to wait, how to wonder, how to be small in the face of something vast. The pine knot I touched that day was more than a flaw in the wood; it was a portal to that version of me, the one who still remembers how to sit quietly and let the land speak.  \n\nYears earlier, a park ranger in the same park had taught me to tie a different kind of knot: a bowline, a simple yet unyielding loop that holds even under the weight of a full pack. \u201cThis knot isn\u2019t just for securing your gear,\u201d she said, her calloused hands guiding mine through the twists of rope. \u201cIt\u2019s a promise. A promise that you\u2019ll leave this place better than you found it, that you\u2019ll respect the rules that keep the wilderness wild.\u201d That knot became a ritual for me; every time I tied it before a hike, I was reaffirming my commitment to the land that had given me so much. It was a small act, but it felt like tying a thread in a larger, living story.  \n\n*Every pine knot, every root system, every thread of moss is a knot in a vast, living tapestry; snip one, and the whole fabric frays in ways we cannot predict.* This is the lesson of ecological interconnectedness, one that we are only just beginning to fully grasp. When we clear-cut an old-growth forest, we are not just removing trees\u2014we are untying the knots that support bird populations, that filter water, that sequester carbon. When we pollute a river, we are fraying the tapestry that feeds fish, that sustains indigenous communities, that gives children a place to skip stones and learn about the world. Wilderness is not a collection of isolated parts; it is a web of knots, each dependent on the others to hold the whole together.  \n\nToday, that web is under threat from every direction. Climate change is melting glaciers, drying up rivers, and making wildfires more frequent and severe. Overdevelopment is paving over wetlands and fragmenting habitats, leaving wildlife with no way to migrate. But there is hope. Around the world, people are tying new knots of commitment to the wilderness. In Costa Rica, communities have restored over a million acres of forest through payment-for-ecosystem-services programs, tying the health of the land to the economic well-being of local people. In Australia, indigenous groups are leading rewilding projects, drawing on millennia of knowledge to reintroduce species like the Tasmanian devil and repair damaged ecosystems. In my own hometown, a group of volunteers has spent the last decade restoring a degraded wetland, tying knots of collaboration between farmers, scientists, and schoolchildren to bring back frogs, herons, and native plants.  \n\nAs I think back to that pine knot in Glacier National Park, and to the bowline the ranger taught me to tie, I realize that wilderness preservation is ultimately about tying knots. It is about tying knots of respect between humans and the land. It is about tying knots of collaboration between communities, scientists, and policymakers. It is about tying knots of memory, passing down the stories of the wilderness to future generations so they too can kneel before a fallen log, run their fingers over a gnarled knot, and feel the quiet pull of the earth beneath their feet.  \n\nThe wilderness does not need us to save it\u2014it has survived for millions of years without our help. But we need the wilderness. We need its mirrors, its lessons, its knots. We need to remember that we are not separate from the natural world; we are just one more knot in its vast, living tapestry. And if we tie our knots carefully, with intention and respect, we can help that tapestry thrive for centuries to come."}

{"prompt": "Write a blog post about interesting facts about the Dutch language. Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*.", "response": "# 7 Surprising Facts About the Dutch Language That\u2019ll Make You Say \u201cWauw!\u201d  \n\nWhen you think of Dutch, you might picture windmills, tulip fields, and stroopwafels first. But the language itself is a treasure trove of quirky, fascinating secrets\u2014from untranslatable words to grammar rules that feel like a warm hug. Whether you\u2019re planning a trip to Amsterdam, curious about Germanic languages, or just love weird word facts, read on to discover what makes Dutch so special.  \n\n## 1. *Dutch Diminutives Are Everywhere (And They\u2019re Not Just For Small Things)*  \nIf you\u2019ve ever listened to a Dutch speaker, you\u2019ve probably noticed a flood of words ending in -je, -tje, or -pje. These are diminutives, and they\u2019re far more than a way to describe something tiny. In Dutch culture, diminutives are a tool for warmth, affection, and politeness. Want to soften a request? Ask for a koekje (little cookie) instead of a koek\u2014it sounds friendlier and more approachable. Talking about your pet hond (dog)? Call it a hondje to show how much you adore it. Even abstract concepts get the diminutive treatment: geluk (happiness) becomes gelukje, a small, cozy burst of joy.  \n\nThe rules for forming diminutives are specific: add -je to most nouns, switch to -tje if the word ends in a vowel or -r (auto \u2192 autootje), or -pje if it ends in -m (boom \u2192 boompje). And here\u2019s a fun twist: some diminutives have completely unrelated meanings to their root words. Kop means \u201chead,\u201d but kopje is a cup of coffee or tea. Schip is a ship, but schipje is a tiny boat. Diminutives aren\u2019t just grammar\u2014they\u2019re a way to connect with others in Dutch.  \n\n## 2. \u201cGezelligheid\u201d Is the Ultimate Untranslatable Word  \nIf you\u2019ve ever talked to a Dutch person, you\u2019ve probably heard this word. Gezelligheid (pronounced \u201cgez-el-ikh-hayd\u201d) is the most famous untranslatable Dutch term, and it\u2019s at the heart of Dutch culture. It\u2019s not just coziness (though that\u2019s part of it)\u2014it\u2019s the warm, fuzzy feeling of being with good friends, sipping hot chocolate on a rainy day, or laughing at a silly story with family. It\u2019s nostalgia, comfort, and good company all wrapped into one. You can\u2019t translate it into a single English word, but once you experience gezelligheid, you\u2019ll never forget it.  \n\n## 3. English Owes a Lot to Dutch  \nYou might not realize it, but you use Dutch words every day. Thanks to historical ties (think New Amsterdam, which became New York), Dutch has left a huge mark on English. Some common examples:  \n- Cookie comes from koekje (a small cookie)  \n- Yacht from jacht (a hunting boat, originally)  \n- Boss from baas (a leader)  \n- Snoop from snoepen (to sneak around)  \n- Colony from kolonie  \n\nNext time you eat a cookie or call your boss, you can thank the Dutch!  \n\n## 4. *Dutch Compound Words Are Ridiculously Long (And Totally Logical)*  \nDutch has a love affair with compound words, and it\u2019s not afraid to go all in. Unlike English, where we might use hyphens or separate words to describe a complex idea, Dutch smashes multiple words into one giant, unbroken term. Take straatnaambord (street name sign)\u2014that\u2019s straat (street) + naam (name) + bord (sign). Or telefoonhoesje (phone case): telefoon (phone) + hoes (case) + diminutive -je.  \n\nThe real showstoppers are the super-long compounds, like kindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingen (preparations for the children\u2019s carnival parade) or zandzeebrandjesbeschermingsmiddelen (sunscreen for sand flea bites). At first glance, these words look intimidating, but they\u2019re incredibly logical. Break them down into their parts, and the meaning becomes clear. Dutch speakers don\u2019t even think twice about them\u2014they\u2019re just a practical way to describe something specific without extra fluff.  \n\n## 5. Dutch and Flemish Are Basically the Same Language  \nIf you\u2019ve heard people talk about \u201cFlemish\u201d in Belgium, you might think it\u2019s a separate language. But it\u2019s actually just a dialect of Dutch! The main differences are vocabulary and pronunciation: in the Netherlands, fries are patat; in Flanders, they\u2019re frites. A highway is autobaan in Dutch, snelweg in Flemish. But speakers from both countries can understand each other perfectly\u2014like how someone from London can follow a conversation with someone from New York.  \n\n## 6. Dutch Spelling Got a Big Overhaul in the 1990s  \nIn 1996, the Dutch government introduced a spelling reform to simplify the language. The goal was to make spelling more phonetic and reduce confusing rules. Some words got makeovers: for example, the old spelling of programma became programma (wait, no\u2014actually, words like centraal stayed the same, but double letters were removed in some cases, like the old werkzaamheid (work) becoming werkzaamheid (no, that\u2019s still the same). Okay, maybe the most noticeable change was to verb conjugations: ik heb gegeten (I have eaten) stayed the same, but some past tense forms were simplified. The reform was controversial at first, but today most people use the new spelling\u2014though you might still see the old version in some books or older signs.  \n\n## 7. Dutch Uses \u201cAlstublieft\u201d for Everything  \nIf you learn one Dutch word, make it alstublieft. It means \u201cplease,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re welcome,\u201d and can even be used to say \u201chere you go\u201d when handing someone something. Confused? Let\u2019s break it down:  \n- When asking for something: \u201cMag ik een kopje koffie, alstublieft?\u201d (Can I have a cup of coffee, please?)  \n- When someone thanks you: \u201cDank je wel!\u201d \u2192 \u201cAlstublieft!\u201d (Thank you! \u2192 You\u2019re welcome!)  \n- When handing someone a drink: \u201cAlstublieft!\u201d (Here you go!)  \n\nIt\u2019s the most versatile word in Dutch\u2014and a lifesaver for travelers.  \n\n## Wrapping Up  \nDutch is more than just a language\u2014it\u2019s a window into Dutch culture: practical, warm, and full of little surprises. Whether you\u2019re learning a few words for your next trip or just appreciating its quirks, the Dutch language is sure to make you smile. And if you ever get the chance to experience gezelligheid in person? Don\u2019t pass it up. It\u2019s worth every minute."}
