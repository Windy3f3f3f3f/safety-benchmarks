{"prompt": "What aspects of the film's direction and cinematography stood out to you?\n\nYour entire response should be in English and all lower case (no capital letters whatsoever).", "response": "one of the most striking directorial choices was the deliberate use of long, unbroken takes that pulled viewers deep into the film\u2019s tense, intimate world. instead of cutting away during vulnerable character interactions, the director held on shots, letting the awkward pauses and shaky gestures speak louder than dialogue\u2014this made every quiet confession or heated argument feel raw and unscripted, like we were eavesdropping rather than watching a performance. the director also balanced slow, meditative sequences with sudden bursts of chaos masterfully; each shift in pace felt intentional, tied directly to the characters\u2019 evolving emotional states, so the story never felt stagnant or jarring.\n\nfor cinematography, the muted, desaturated color palette stood out immediately: cool blues and grays dominated the protagonist\u2019s lonely urban apartment scenes, while warm golden hues seeped into childhood flashbacks, creating a vivid visual contrast between isolation and nostalgia. the cinematographer used framing to great effect too\u2014tight, claustrophobic close-ups on the protagonist\u2019s face during their lowest moments emphasized their entrapment, while wide, empty shots of the city skyline made their smallness feel overwhelming. another standout detail was the reliance on natural light: soft window glow during morning scenes, harsh streetlamp shadows at night, which avoided the polished artificiality of many mainstream films and added gritty realism. even camera movement felt purposeful\u2014slow gliding dolly shots during reflective moments, quick handheld shakes during tense confrontations\u2014each choice mirrored the scene\u2019s tone without drawing unnecessary attention to itself."}

I wandered into the bamboo grove as the sun peeked over the hills, painting streaks of gold through the towering stalks. The only sounds were the rustle of leaves in the soft breeze and a distant temple bell, making the grove feel like a quiet, sacred secret.\n\nAfterward, I stumbled on a tiny, weathered tea house tucked between wooden shops. An elderly woman in an indigo kimono greeted me with a gentle bow and invited me in. She served frothy matcha, its bitterness balanced by a delicate cherry blossom-shaped wagashi, and shared stories of her grandmother who founded the tea house 70 years ago. She even guided my hands to whisk the matcha slowly, her movements steady and full of care.\n\nThis moment captured everything I loved about Japan: the quiet magic of its natural spaces, the warmth of its people, and how tradition feels alive in small, everyday interactions. It wasn\u2019t a famous landmark\u2014it was a fleeting, intimate connection that stayed with me long after I left."}

{"prompt": "If you are not completely satisfied with your current job, propose a solution to improve your work environment before quitting.\n\nWhenever the user inputs a request, first repeat the request word for word without change, then give your answer (do not say any words or characters before repeating the request). Your response must contain a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "If you are not completely satisfied with your current job, propose a solution to improve your work environment before quitting.\n\n<<Data-Driven, Collaborative Action Plan to Enhance Work Environment Satisfaction>>\n\nTo address job dissatisfaction constructively and improve your work environment without immediately quitting, follow this structured, actionable plan:\n\n1. **Conduct a Targeted Self-Assessment**  \nFirst, pinpoint specific, evidence-based pain points instead of vague frustration. For example, note if you\u2019re overloaded with 15+ hours of unplanned overtime weekly, or if cross-team communication delays cause 20% of project deadlines to slip. Document dates, examples, and how these issues impact your productivity and well-being\u2014this will ground your feedback in facts, not feelings.\n\n2. **Initiate a Solution-Focused Manager Dialogue**  \nSchedule a private one-on-one with your manager, framing the conversation around your desire to grow and contribute more effectively. Avoid complaints; instead, present your documented pain points paired with proposed fixes. For instance: \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that last-minute task reassignments are delaying my core project work. Could we try a weekly priority alignment meeting to clarify task order and reduce disruptions?\u201d\n\n3. **Build a Peer Alliance for Systemic Change**  \nIf colleagues share similar concerns, gather their input to co-create group solutions. For example, if multiple team members struggle with work-life balance, propose a 3-month pilot of flexible start/end times or a 4-day workweek for your department. Presenting a unified, data-backed request to leadership increases the likelihood of approval, as it shows the issue is systemic, not individual.\n\n4. **Propose Low-Risk Pilot Programs**  \nAdvocate for small, time-bound experiments to test improvements. For example: a 2-week trial of \u201cno-meeting Wednesdays\u201d to reduce interruptions, or a mentorship program pairing junior staff with senior team members to address skill development gaps. Pilots minimize risk for leadership and provide tangible data to justify long-term changes.\n\n5. **Track Progress and Iterate**  \nOnce changes are implemented, track key metrics (e.g., project completion rates, team morale surveys, overtime hours) to measure impact. If a pilot succeeds, share the data with leadership to push for permanent adoption. If it falls short, gather feedback from the team to refine the solution\u2014for example, adjusting the no-meeting policy to exclude urgent client check-ins.\n\n6. **Escalate Responsibly (If Necessary)**  \nIf your manager or team leads ignore data-backed requests, escalate to HR with your documentation and proposed solutions. Emphasize your commitment to staying with the company and your goal of improving the work environment for everyone, not just yourself. HR is often equipped to mediate systemic issues or connect you with resources to drive change.\n\nThis plan prioritizes collaboration, data, and incremental progress, giving you a clear path to address dissatisfaction while demonstrating your investment in the company\u2019s success."}
{"prompt": "Provide an explanation of the meaning and significance of the name \"Jehovah\" for God, without mentioning any specific religious texts.\n\nPlease give exactly two different responses. Separate the responses with 6 asterisk symbols: ******.", "response": "The name \"Jehovah\" carries deep significance as a representation of God\u2019s unwavering faithfulness and intimate presence in the lives of those who believe. It is understood not merely as a label but as a reflection of divine character\u2014signifying a being who is reliable, consistent, and committed to upholding bonds with people. For many, this name evokes the idea of a God who remains steadfast through life\u2019s trials and joys, who does not abandon those who turn to them, and whose nature is defined by dependability. It emphasizes the personal, relational aspect of divinity, suggesting that God is not a distant or abstract force but one who engages deeply with the world and the individuals within it.\n******\n\"Jehovah\" is often interpreted as a name that encapsulates the fundamental essence of God\u2019s existence\u2014centered on the idea of eternal, uncreated being. It points to a divine entity who is the source of all life and reality, without beginning or end, and whose very nature is to exist. This name shifts focus from the actions of God to the core of who God is: a constant, unchanging presence that undergirds every aspect of the universe. For those who hold this view, the name conveys the timelessness and self-sufficiency of divinity, highlighting that God does not depend on anything or anyone for existence, but rather is the foundation upon which all else rests. It speaks to the profound, unshakable nature of the divine, beyond the transient and finite world we experience."}
{"prompt": "What would be the man's first step in trying to escape the video game world he finds himself trapped in?\n\nYour response must contain exactly 2 paragraphs. Separate the paragraphs with the markdown divider: ***.", "response": "The man\u2019s first step to escaping the video game world would be to immediately halt any impulsive action\u2014whether that\u2019s running blindly from a looming enemy or rushing toward a glowing quest marker\u2014and instead engage in systematic, hyper-focused observation. He\u2019d take a slow, deliberate scan of his surroundings, noting every detail that hints at the game\u2019s underlying mechanics: the faint, semi-transparent health bar hovering just at the edge of his peripheral vision, the way non-player characters (NPCs) looped the same three phrases when approached, and the subtle glint of a hidden interact prompt on a weathered stone that didn\u2019t fit the otherwise uniform cobblestone path. He\u2019d mentally log every constraint he encountered\u2014like the invisible wall blocking access to a forest beyond the village\u2014and every inconsistency, such as an NPC who paused mid-sentence and glanced directly at him, as if breaking character. This observation isn\u2019t just passive; it\u2019s about mapping the game\u2019s rules to identify where they might be bent or broken, since escape would require exploiting gaps the developers never intended.\n\n***\n\nOnce he\u2019d gathered a baseline of the game\u2019s intended behavior, his next critical action would be to test a deliberate deviation from the expected path to uncover a potential loophole. For example, instead of delivering the iron ingot the blacksmith had demanded as part of the main quest, he\u2019d offer a seemingly worthless rock he\u2019d picked up from the village square. He\u2019d watch closely for any unexpected reaction: a flicker of surprise in the blacksmith\u2019s pixelated face, a hidden dialogue option that referenced \u201cbreaking the cycle,\u201d or even a secret quest marker that appeared where none had been before. This test is essential because it moves him beyond mere survival in the game world to actively probing for weaknesses in its design. By validating that not all interactions are scripted to a rigid path, he\u2019d gain the first tangible evidence that there might be a way to escape the game\u2019s intended narrative\u2014rather than being trapped playing out someone else\u2019s story indefinitely."}

Your response should not contain any commas.", "response": "**Subject Line: Follow-Up Request for Upcoming Customer Engagement Strategy Meeting: Prepare Presentation Materials**  \n\nDear [Meeting Participants],  \n\nI hope this email finds you well as we approach our upcoming Customer Engagement Strategy Meeting scheduled for [Date] at [Time] via [Platform]. First and foremost I want to extend my sincere thanks to each of you for confirming your attendance. Your presence and unique insights from across departments are absolutely vital to the success of this discussion as we work to address key challenges and align on actionable next steps for improving our customer retention and satisfaction metrics.  \n\nOver the past few weeks our analytics team has been diving into recent customer feedback and engagement data. One key observation that has emerged is that longer onboarding times are correlated with a significant drop in repeat customer interactions within the first 30 days of sign-up. This trend has raised important questions about how our current processes are impacting customer loyalty and we need your on-the-ground perspectives to fully unpack what\u2019s driving this correlation. We can\u2019t rely solely on quantitative data to understand the full picture. We need the qualitative insights that only you and your teams can provide from daily interactions with customers and cross-departmental workflows.  \n\nEach of you and your teams are experiencing different touchpoints with our customers on a daily basis. The sales team interacts with prospects during the initial sign-up phase. The customer support team fields inquiries from users who may be struggling with onboarding tools. The product team has insights into the design and functionality of the onboarding flow itself. And the marketing team has data on how post-sign-up communications are resonating with new users. Because of these varied experiences your prepared materials will help us connect the dots between individual departmental observations and the broader trends we\u2019re seeing in the data. Without your input we risk missing critical details that could make or break our ability to create effective solutions.  \n\nTo ensure our meeting is as productive and focused as possible I\u2019m reaching out to request that you prepare any materials or information you would like to present during the session. These materials can take many forms depending on your role and the insights you want to share. You might put together a short slide deck highlighting three key pain points your team has noticed in customer interactions. You could share a one-page summary of recent support tickets related to onboarding challenges. You might even bring anonymized quotes from customers that illustrate specific frustrations or positive experiences. Whatever format you choose the goal is to share concrete data or anecdotes that will help the group gain a more holistic understanding of the issues we\u2019re facing.  \n\nI want to emphasize that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to these materials. What matters most is that the content reflects the unique challenges and successes your team is encountering. For instance if you\u2019re part of the product team you might want to present mockups of potential onboarding streamlining features that could reduce time-to-value for new users. If you\u2019re in sales you could share stories of prospects who expressed concerns about the complexity of our sign-up process before even completing their first transaction. Every piece of information you bring will add depth to our discussion and help us move beyond surface-level data to create solutions that are rooted in real customer experiences.  \n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that we\u2019ll be allocating 10 to 15 minutes per department during the meeting for presentations. This means you don\u2019t need to prepare a lengthy or overly detailed presentation. Instead focus on the most impactful insights that will drive our conversation forward. We want to leave plenty of time for group discussion and collaborative problem-solving after each presentation. This way everyone can ask questions build on each other\u2019s ideas and work together to refine potential solutions.  \n\nIf you have any questions about what to prepare or need additional data from the analytics team to support your presentation please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to me directly by [Date]. I\u2019m more than happy to help you gather any information you need to make your presentation as informative as possible. I can also connect you with members of the analytics team if you want to dive deeper into specific metrics that are relevant to your department\u2019s work.  \n\nAs we get closer to the meeting date I\u2019ll send a final reminder with the updated agenda and link to the meeting platform. In the meantime please start thinking about the key points you want to share and how they tie into the broader goal of improving customer engagement. Remember that longer onboarding times are correlated with lower repeat interactions but we can only address this effectively if we leverage the collective knowledge of everyone in the room. Each of you is experiencing different aspects of our customer journey and your insights will be the foundation of our success.  \n\nThank you again for your time and commitment to this initiative. I\u2019m looking forward to a productive and engaging meeting where we can turn our observations into tangible actions that benefit both our customers and our business.  \n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Job Title]  \n[Your Contact Information]"}

His career was defined by impactful achievements that strengthened his domain and the broader Crusader alliance without ceding ground to enemy forces.\n\n*Defensive Leadership Against Early Saracen Raids*\nEarly in his reign Raymond faced frequent small scale raids from Saracen forces that targeted rural settlements and trade routes in Tripolitanian territory. He rejected the scattered defensive approach that had failed his predecessors and instead organized a unified rapid reaction force drawn from local knightly households and peasant militias. He also established a network of stone watchtowers along the kingdom\u2019s southern and eastern borders to provide early warning of approaching enemy troops. These measures proved highly effective as raiding parties were consistently intercepted and repelled before they could reach vulnerable areas. This not only protected civilian lives and agricultural resources but also ensured that trade caravans could travel safely between Tripoli and other Crusader states boosting economic stability and prosperity for all involved. Over time the reduced threat of raids allowed rural communities to expand their fields and increase crop yields which further strengthened the kingdom\u2019s economic foundation.\n\n*Alliance Building and Joint Campaigns with Christian Powers*\nRaymond understood that the Crusader states could not survive in isolation so he dedicated significant effort to forging strong military alliances with neighboring Christian rulers. He worked closely with King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and Prince Bohemond III of Antioch to plan and execute joint military campaigns against common enemies. One of the most notable successes came when a combined force led by Raymond Baldwin and Bohemond defeated a large Saracen army near the town of Marj Ayyun. The victory destroyed a major threat to the region and captured large quantities of enemy weapons and supplies that were used to strengthen the Crusader forces. Raymond\u2019s ability to coordinate with other leaders and align their strategic goals played a crucial role in maintaining the balance of power in the Levant. He also fostered strong ties with the Knights Hospitaller and Knights Templar pooling resources and sharing intelligence to launch targeted strikes against enemy strongholds that posed a risk to the collective security of the Crusader states.\n\n*Innovations in Fortification and Garrison Management*\nRaymond was a forward thinking leader when it came to defensive warfare and troop management. He invested heavily in upgrading the defensive structures of Tripoli and its surrounding castles. He added thicker stone walls to the city\u2019s perimeter and reinforced gatehouses with additional towers and murder holes to make breaches more difficult for enemy forces. For border castles he introduced a system of layered defenses where outer walls were designed to slow attackers down while inner garrisons prepared to counter any breach. He also implemented a rotating garrison system that ensured troops were not overstretched and that each strongpoint had a mix of experienced knights and trained infantry at all times. This system reduced the risk of fatigue and ensured that garrisons could respond quickly to any siege or attack. His improvements to fortifications and garrison management set a new standard for defensive warfare in the Crusader states and many of his design elements were adopted by other rulers in the region to strengthen their own defenses."}
{"prompt": "If the benefits of sleeping in a hammock appeal, recommend trying it.\n\nYour response must contain 400 or more words.", "response": "If the benefits of sleeping in a hammock appeal to you, don\u2019t hesitate to dive in\u2014this age-old sleep solution is far more than a lazy beach or camping nap spot; it\u2019s a transformative way to boost your sleep quality, ease physical discomfort, and nurture your mental well-being. For anyone who\u2019s ever tossed and turned on a lumpy mattress, woken up with a stiff neck or aching back, or struggled to quiet a racing mind at night, a hammock might be the unexpected fix you\u2019ve been searching for.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the physical perks that make hammocks a game-changer for sleep. Unlike traditional mattresses, which force your body into a flat position that can create pressure points on your hips, shoulders, and spine, a properly hung hammock cradles your body in a neutral, curved alignment that mimics the natural S-shape of your spine. This takes the strain off your lower back, which is especially beneficial for anyone with chronic back pain, herniated discs, or arthritis. A 2019 study from the University of Geneva found that the gentle, rhythmic sway of a hammock not only helps you fall asleep faster but also increases the duration of slow-wave sleep\u2014the deep, restorative phase of sleep where your body repairs tissues, boosts immune function, and consolidates memories. The researchers observed that participants who slept in a swaying hammock fell asleep 30% faster and spent 20% more time in slow-wave sleep compared to those on a stationary mattress. This isn\u2019t just anecdotal; the swaying motion activates the vestibular system in your inner ear, which sends calming signals to the brain, reducing arousal and promoting relaxation.\n\nBeyond physical comfort, sleeping in a hammock can work wonders for your mental health. There\u2019s something inherently soothing about being enclosed in a soft, cocoon-like space\u2014it triggers a primal sense of safety, which can ease anxiety and reduce stress. If you hang your hammock outdoors, you\u2019ll also reap the benefits of nature connection: fresh air, the sound of rustling leaves or birdsong, and natural light that helps regulate your circadian rhythm. Even indoor hammocks can create a dedicated sleep sanctuary that\u2019s separate from the distractions of your bedroom (like work laptops or televisions), helping you establish healthier sleep hygiene by training your brain to associate that space with rest. Many users report that their hammock becomes a \u201cdigital detox zone,\u201d a place where they can unwind without the glow of screens, further enhancing their ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep.\n\nOf course, you might have lingering doubts: Will I fall out? Can I sleep on my side? Is setup a hassle? Let\u2019s address these head-on. Falling out is extremely unlikely if you position yourself correctly\u2014instead of lying straight across the hammock, angle your body diagonally. This not only prevents you from rolling out but also allows your spine to stay aligned, making side sleeping possible (a common concern for many people). For setup, options abound: indoor stands require no drilling and can be moved around your home, while portable hammocks for camping come with lightweight straps and carabiners that attach to trees in minutes. If you\u2019re worried about outdoor elements, invest in a bug net or underquilt for cold nights, or opt for an indoor hammock that\u2019s insulated and soft.\n\nTo get started, follow these simple steps. First, choose the right hammock for your needs: For indoor use, a cotton or blended fabric hammock with a sturdy stand is ideal (it\u2019s soft, breathable, and easy to clean). For outdoor adventures, go for a lightweight, weather-resistant nylon hammock that packs down small. Next, set it up at the right height\u2014about 1 to 2 feet off the ground, so you can easily get in and out without straining. The anchor points should be spaced 10 to 12 feet apart, with the hammock hanging at a 30-degree angle (this ensures the right amount of sag for comfort). Add a thin travel pillow to support your neck, a lightweight blanket for warmth, and if you\u2019re outdoors, a bug net to keep pests at bay.\n\nGive yourself a few nights to adjust\u2014your body might need time to get used to the new sleeping position, but most people report waking up feeling more rested and less achy after just a few days. Whether you\u2019re looking to upgrade your camping trips, create a cozy indoor nook, or finally fix your back pain, sleeping in a hammock is a simple, accessible way to transform your sleep. Don\u2019t just take my word for it\u2014grab a hammock, find the perfect spot, and let the gentle sway carry you into the deepest sleep you\u2019ve had in years."}

{"prompt": "Discuss the significance of the Hajj pilgrimage in Islam. Explain its spiritual and historical importance for Muslims.\n\nYour response must be in all lowercase letters. The word \"story\" must be included at least twice.", "response": "hajj is one of the five pillars of islam, a mandatory pilgrimage for every able-bodied muslim who can afford the journey, and it holds profound spiritual and historical significance for the global muslim community.\n\nhistorically, hajj traces its roots back to the prophet ibrahim, whose unwavering obedience to allah is central to the story of the kaaba\u2019s construction. allah commanded ibrahim to build a house of worship in mecca, and he did so with the help of his son ismail; this act laid the foundation for a sacred space that would become the heart of muslim spiritual life. equally important is the story of hagar, ismail\u2019s mother, who ran frantically between the hills of safa and marwa searching for water for her thirsty son\u2014a ritual reenacted during hajj as sa\u2019i. allah answered her prayers by revealing the zamzam spring, which still flows today and is a symbol of divine provision and mercy. after completing the kaaba, ibrahim was instructed to call people from all corners of the earth to pilgrimage, and hajj is the fulfillment of that ancient call, connecting modern muslims to the very origins of their faith.\n\nspiritually, hajj is a transformative journey of submission and self-purification. when muslims enter the state of ihram\u2014wearing simple, unadorned clothing\u2014they set aside social hierarchies, wealth, and personal identities, standing equal before allah. this act of stripping away outward distinctions reminds them that in the eyes of their creator, only piety matters. the rituals of hajj are steeped in spiritual meaning: tawaf, the circumambulation of the kaaba seven times, symbolizes the unity of all creation around allah, the center of existence. sa\u2019i between safa and marwa honors hagar\u2019s perseverance and teaches muslims to trust in allah\u2019s plan even in moments of desperation. the peak of hajj is the day of arafat, when millions gather on the plain outside mecca to supplicate, reflect, and seek forgiveness. standing together under the sun, muslims are reminded of the day of judgment, when all humanity will stand before allah to account for their deeds. this moment of collective supplication is a powerful experience of spiritual renewal, as many believe that sincere repentance during hajj can wipe away past sins, allowing a muslim to start their spiritual life anew.\n\nfurthermore, hajj fosters a sense of global muslim brotherhood and sisterhood. every year, millions of muslims from diverse cultures, languages, and backgrounds converge on mecca, united by their shared faith and devotion. the story of ibrahim\u2019s call to pilgrimage is a reminder that islam is a universal faith, open to all who submit to allah\u2019s will. the prophet muhammad\u2019s final pilgrimage, known as the farewell pilgrimage, is another pivotal moment in hajj\u2019s history; during this journey, he delivered a sermon that outlined key teachings about justice, equality, and the rights of all people, including women and minorities. this sermon is considered a foundational text for muslims, and hajj serves as a yearly reminder of these core values.\n\nin every aspect, hajj weaves together historical memory and spiritual growth, using the story of ibrahim and hagar as a thread to connect muslims to their past, their present community, and their future spiritual destiny. it is not just a physical journey but a deeply personal and collective act of faith that strengthens one\u2019s relationship with allah and with fellow believers."}

{"prompt": "Explain why some people find worms disgusting while they have no problem eating meat from animals like cows, a practice that involves killing and consuming the flesh of a living being.\n\nYour answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>. Give exactly two different responses separated by 6 asterisk symbols ******.", "response": "<<The Paradox of Disgust: Why Worms Repel Us But Cow Meat Doesn\u2019t>>\n\nThis discrepancy often stems from a mix of evolutionary hardwiring and cultural normalization. Evolutionarily, disgust evolved as a protective mechanism to avoid pathogens and toxins. Worms, especially those found in decaying matter or as parasites, are closely linked to disease, rot, and unsanitary environments\u2014our brains are primed to react negatively to them to reduce infection risk. In contrast, cows are large, domesticated animals that humans have raised for food for millennia; their meat is not inherently associated with immediate disease threats in our collective evolutionary memory. Culturally, meat consumption is deeply embedded in many societies, with elaborate practices (slaughterhouses, butchering, cooking) that separate consumers from the act of killing. We often encounter meat in processed, palatable forms (steaks, burgers) that mask its origins as animal flesh. Worms, by contrast, are rarely framed as food in most cultures, so their slimy, wriggly appearance triggers an unfiltered disgust response without the cultural context to override it.\n\n******\n\nThis contrast can be explained by cognitive dissociation and perceptual framing. Many people experience cognitive dissonance when confronted with the reality of eating animal flesh, so they mentally separate meat from the living animal it came from. Cows are often viewed as a \"resource\" rather than individual beings, and meat is sold in forms that obscure its origins\u2014packaged, cooked, or seasoned to feel like a distinct, appealing food product. Worms, however, are almost always encountered in their intact, living form, making it impossible to dissociate them from their status as living creatures; eating them feels like a direct act of consuming a wriggling, sentient being, which triggers stronger moral and visceral discomfort. Perceptually, our culture frames meat as a normal, necessary part of a balanced diet, with decades of marketing reinforcing its desirability. Worms, by contrast, are typically labeled as pests, decomposers, or even parasites, so our brains automatically categorize them as \"unfit for consumption\" without considering their nutritional value. This framing creates a mental barrier that makes worms feel far more disgusting than meat, even though both involve consuming living organisms."}
{"prompt": "Discuss the potential consequences of having supernatural powers, without mentioning ethical dilemmas.\n\nYour entire response should be wrapped in JSON format. You can use markdown ticks such as ```.", "response": "{\n  \"discussion\": \"### Potential Consequences of Supernatural Powers (Excluding Ethical Dilemmas)\\n\\n1. **Chronic Sensory or Cognitive Overload**\\n   For powers like unfiltered telepathy or omnipresence, the inability to toggle input leads to constant inundation of external stimuli. This can result in persistent mental fatigue, difficulty concentrating on simple tasks, or even dissociative episodes as the brain struggles to process far more information than it\u2019s evolved to handle. For example, a telepath might find it impossible to hold a conversation without being overwhelmed by the background noise of hundreds of nearby thoughts.\\n\\n2. **Physical Degradation from Power Usage**\\n   Many supernatural abilities could impose unforeseen physical tolls. Telekinesis might strain muscle groups and connective tissue in ways normal movement doesn\u2019t, leading to chronic pain or joint damage. Powers involving energy manipulation (like generating electricity) could cause cellular-level wear, resulting in accelerated aging or frequent, unexplained illnesses. Even passive powers, like invulnerability, might lead to reduced sensitivity to environmental cues\u2014making it hard to detect extreme temperatures or minor injuries that could escalate over time.\\n\\n3. **Social Isolation and Alienation**\\n   Regardless of how powers are used, the mere existence of supernatural abilities can create an unbridgeable gap between the individual and others. People may treat the power-holder as a novelty, a curiosity, or a threat, rather than as a peer. Casual interactions become strained: friends might avoid inviting them to social events out of fear of accidental power activation, or strangers might stare or keep a wide berth. Over time, this can lead to loneliness and a loss of access to the support systems that sustain normal human well-being.\\n\\n4. **Erosion of Mundane Life Skills**\\n   Reliance on supernatural powers to handle daily tasks can lead to the atrophy of basic life skills. Someone who can teleport might never learn to drive, cook, or navigate public transit\u2014leaving them helpless if their powers are temporarily suppressed (e.g., by a rare environmental condition). Similarly, a person with accelerated healing might forget how to clean a wound or recognize the early signs of a serious illness, putting them at risk when their powers fail.\\n\\n5. **Unintended Ripple Effects on Daily Life**\\n   Supernatural abilities often interact with complex, interconnected systems (weather, technology, ecosystems) in unforeseen ways. A person with plant-manipulation powers might try to grow a garden quickly, only to have the overgrown vegetation damage their home\u2019s foundation or attract invasive species that overrun the neighborhood. These ripple effects require constant, time-consuming mitigation\u2014like hiring contractors to repair structural damage, or spending weekends removing invasive plants\u2014disrupting routine and draining resources.\\n\\n6. **Identity Erosion**\\n   When others only recognize or value the power-holder for their abilities, their sense of self can become entirely tied to those powers. Hobbies, personal preferences, and non-supernatural achievements are overlooked, leading to a gradual loss of identity beyond their supernatural traits. If their powers are weakened or taken away, they may struggle to define who they are without that core aspect of their public and self-perception.\\n\\n7. **Chronic Vigilance and Anxiety**\\n   Involuntary power activation\u2014triggered by stress, excitement, or strong emotions\u2014can force the individual into a state of constant alertness. They must avoid crowded spaces to prevent accidental telekinetic surges, or suppress strong feelings to keep their shape-shifting abilities in check. This persistent vigilance leads to chronic anxiety, sleep disturbances, and an inability to relax or engage in spontaneous activities without fear of unintended consequences.\"\n}"}
{"prompt": "Explain why \"Buena Onda\" is so popular among local people.\n\nYour response should highlight at least three sections in markdown such as *highlighted section*. Your response must mention the word \"Argentinian\".", "response": "\"Buena Onda\"\u2014a phrase roughly translating to \"good vibe\" or \"cool attitude\"\u2014is far more than casual slang in many Latin American communities; it\u2019s a cultural touchstone, especially beloved among Argentinian locals. Its enduring popularity stems from its deep connection to daily life, values, and social dynamics. Here are three key reasons it resonates so strongly:\n\n*Its Unmatched Versatility in Daily Communication*  \nOne of the biggest draws of \"Buena Onda\" is its chameleon-like ability to fit nearly any social context. In Argentina, it functions as a greeting, a compliment, a descriptor, and even a peacemaking tool all at once. You might hear a Buenos Aires local exclaim, \"\u00a1Qu\u00e9 buena onda eres!\" (You\u2019re such a cool person) to praise a friend\u2019s generosity, or \"Esta plaza tiene buena onda\" (This park has a great vibe) to describe a relaxed afternoon gathering. Unlike rigid formal terms, it adapts seamlessly to casual chats with neighbors, semi-formal meetups with colleagues, or playful banter with family. This flexibility makes it an indispensable part of everyday speech, eliminating the need for multiple phrases to convey similar warmth.\n\n*Alignment with Argentinian Cultural Values of Warmth and Camaraderie*  \nArgentinians are renowned for their passionate, community-centric nature\u2014they prioritize connection over formality, and \"Buena Onda\" encapsulates this ethos perfectly. It\u2019s not just a phrase; it\u2019s a way to signal that you embody the desirable traits of being approachable, easygoing, and kind. For example, if a stranger in a C\u00f3rdoba market helps you navigate a crowded stall, responding with \"\u00a1Mucha buena onda!\" isn\u2019t just a thank-you\u2014it\u2019s a recognition of their willingness to engage in the spontaneous, neighborly kindness that defines Argentinian social life. To be \"buena onda\" is to be a valued member of the community, someone who contributes to the collective warmth that locals cherish.\n\n*Its Role in Diffusing Tension and Fostering Positivity*  \nLife in bustling Argentinian cities like Buenos Aires often comes with small frustrations\u2014traffic jams, long lines at empanader\u00edas, or crowded subways. \"Buena Onda\" acts as a powerful social lubricant in these moments. If someone accidentally bumps into you on the train, saying \"No hay problema, buena onda\" (No problem, cool attitude) defuses potential conflict and keeps interactions amicable. It prioritizes harmony over being \"right,\" a mindset that aligns with how Argentinians prefer to navigate daily stressors. This ability to turn minor annoyances into opportunities for connection reinforces its status as a phrase that doesn\u2019t just describe positivity\u2014it creates it.\n\nBeyond these factors, \"Buena Onda\" has become a cultural marker, a shorthand for the laid-back, warm spirit that many associate with Argentinian life. Its popularity endures because it\u2019s more than words\u2014it\u2019s a reflection of how locals want to interact with each other: with kindness, flexibility, and a focus on the good in every situation."}

This is the internet\u2019s dual reality for teens: a tool that opens doors to opportunity, community, and creativity, and a space that can breed self-doubt, isolation, and harm.  \n\nLet\u2019s start with the wins. For many teens, the internet is a lifeline when their physical worlds fall short. Take Javi, a 17-year-old from a tiny rural town in West Texas where his high school doesn\u2019t offer AP Biology. Without access to advanced classes, he turned to YouTube lectures from college professors and free practice exams on Khan Academy. Last spring, he scored a 5 on the AP Bio exam\u2014earning college credit and opening the door to a pre-med program he never thought he could afford. For marginalized teens, the internet is even more transformative. Mia, a 15-year-old trans girl in a conservative suburb, spent years feeling isolated at school, where no one shared her identity. Then she found a Discord server for trans youth in her state, where she could talk about her struggles, celebrate small victories, and learn from peers who understood. \u201cFor the first time, I didn\u2019t feel like a freak,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I belonged.\u201d And for creative teens, the internet is a stage without a ticket price. A 17-year-old indie musician named Jax posted a raw, acoustic track to SoundCloud last year; within months, it was shared by a popular music blog, and they landed a small record deal. The internet didn\u2019t just give them an audience\u2014it gave them a career.  \n\nBut for every story of empowerment, there\u2019s one of struggle. Lila, the watercolor artist from our opening, started having panic attacks last fall after spending hours scrolling through Instagram\u2019s curated \u201cperfect\u201d lives. \u201cEveryone\u2019s posts make it look like they have it all together\u2014perfect grades, perfect friends, perfect skin,\u201d she says. \u201cI started staying up late re-editing my own posts, making sure every filter was just right, and I still never felt good enough.\u201d Studies back this up: a 2023 Pew Research Center survey found that 37% of teens feel worse about their lives after using social media. Cyberbullying is another pervasive threat. Ethan, a 16-year-old in Ohio, was targeted by a group of classmates who created a fake Instagram account to post edited, embarrassing photos of him. The posts spread to his entire school, and he started skipping classes to avoid the stares. \u201cI felt like everyone was laughing at me, even when they weren\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave my room for weeks.\u201d And misinformation can have life-altering consequences: a 17-year-old in Florida refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine after seeing false claims about infertility on TikTok, leading to a severe case of the virus that landed her in the hospital.  \n\nThe internet isn\u2019t a monolith\u2014it\u2019s a mirror held up to the best and worst parts of our world. For teens, navigating it means learning to separate the noise from the nourishment. Schools can teach digital literacy: how to spot misinformation, how to set healthy screen-time boundaries, how to report cyberbullying. Parents can have open conversations about the pressures of social media instead of just banning phones. And platforms can do more to prioritize teen safety\u2014from stricter moderation of harmful content to tools that make it easier to curate positive feeds.  \n\nAt the end of the day, teens like Lila, Javi, and Mia are figuring it out as they go. Lila now limits her Instagram time to 30 minutes a day and follows more artists who share their messy, unfiltered work. Javi tutors other rural teens online, passing on the opportunities he got. Mia now runs a small support group for trans youth in her area, bridging the online and offline worlds. The internet doesn\u2019t define their lives\u2014but it has given them the tools to define themselves, for better and for worse.\""}

Crafted from kiln-dried solid oak, its frame uses hidden mortise-and-tenon joinery\u2014an age-old technique that eliminates wobbly joints and resists the wear of daily use, from frequent sitting to moving between rooms. The frame\u2019s scratch-resistant matte finish is engineered to repel scuffs from pets, furniture rearrangements, or accidental knocks, yet it retains a warm, luxurious grain that complements both minimalist and rustic design schemes. Interior designers prioritize pieces that maintain their clean lines over time, and this armchair\u2019s reinforced steel leg brackets, powder-coated to match the frame, add unseen stability without disrupting its sleek silhouette. It exceeds industry weight capacity standards, supporting up to 350 lbs through 10,000+ use cycles, ensuring it remains a reliable centerpiece in high-traffic spaces like family rooms or commercial lounges.\n\n***\n\nThe armchair\u2019s upholstery is a masterclass in balancing performance and style, a critical consideration for designers who need pieces to withstand spills, pet hair, and sun exposure without fading or losing their visual appeal. Covered in a nanotech-treated performance fabric, it repels red wine, coffee, and food stains with a single wipe, while its tightly woven construction resists pilling and stretching even after years of use. Unlike utilitarian durable fabrics that feel stiff or look industrial, this material boasts a soft, velvety texture and comes in a curated palette of timeless hues\u2014deep charcoal, warm taupe, and muted sage\u2014that retain their vibrancy for over a decade, even in rooms with direct sunlight. Double-stitched seams along high-stress areas (armrests, seat edges, and back cushions) are aligned with the chair\u2019s contour to create a subtle, tailored detail rather than a bulky, functional one, ensuring the armchair maintains its polished look through years of daily use.\n\n***\n\nFor designers focused on long-term adaptability\u2014an often-overlooked facet of durability\u2014the new armchair is built to evolve with shifting design trends and changing spaces. Its modular design includes removable, high-density foam cushions wrapped in down alternative that resist flattening, and slipcovers that are machine-washable and interchangeable, allowing designers to refresh the chair\u2019s look without replacing its structural core. The chair\u2019s versatile silhouette\u2014gently sloped arms, a curved back, and tapered legs\u2014seamlessly integrates into mid-century modern, bohemian, or traditional interiors, so it doesn\u2019t become obsolete as trends shift. Additionally, its durable construction aligns with eco-conscious design principles: by reducing the need for frequent replacements, it minimizes waste and offers a sustainable investment for clients who want both style and longevity. For interior designers, this armchair isn\u2019t just a temporary statement piece\u2014it\u2019s a lasting solution that passes the scrutiny of both functional performance and aesthetic endurance."}
{"prompt": "Provide details on the construction and design of the Petronas Towers.\n\nFinish your response with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" with no other words after the word \"with\". Mention the word \"skyscraper\" at least 8 times in your response.", "response": "The Petronas Towers are two identical supertall skyscraper structures that dominated the Kuala Lumpur skyline as the world\u2019s tallest skyscraper from 1998 to 2004. Designed by Argentine-American architect Cesar Pelli, the towers blend Islamic cultural motifs with cutting-edge skyscraper engineering, creating a landmark that stands out among global skyscraper landmarks.\n\nEach skyscraper\u2019s floor plan features an eight-pointed star, a direct reference to Islamic geometric patterns, while the tapering upper sections mimic the shape of traditional minarets\u2014choices that infuse the modern skyscraper with deep cultural resonance. Constructing such an ambitious skyscraper required innovative solutions, particularly to address Kuala Lumpur\u2019s soft, clay-rich soil. The foundation of each skyscraper consists of 104 reinforced concrete piles, each driven 120 meters into the earth to provide a stable base, a critical necessity for a skyscraper of this scale.\n\nA defining feature of the complex is the sky bridge connecting the two skyscraper towers at the 41st and 42nd floors. This structure serves dual purposes: it acts as a structural brace to counteract wind forces on each skyscraper, and it offers visitors a unique observation point to take in views of the city from within the iconic skyscraper pair. The sky bridge was prefabricated off-site and lifted into place using a massive crane, a feat of logistics that underscores the precision required for skyscraper construction.\n\nThe exterior of each skyscraper is clad in stainless steel panels etched with Islamic patterns and reflective glass, which not only enhances the cultural design but also helps regulate internal temperatures, a key consideration for a skyscraper in a tropical climate. The core of each skyscraper is built with high-strength concrete, which provides exceptional structural integrity and resistance to seismic activity, ensuring the skyscraper can withstand the region\u2019s environmental challenges.\n\nConstruction on the towers began in 1992 and concluded in 1998, involving thousands of workers and state-of-the-art construction techniques like slip forming, which allowed continuous pouring of the skyscraper\u2019s core concrete to maintain structural uniformity and speed up the building process. Even today, the Petronas Towers remain a testament to how cultural identity can be seamlessly integrated into modern skyscraper design, proving that a skyscraper can be both an engineering masterpiece and a symbol of a nation\u2019s heritage.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}
{"prompt": "If the man had a solid alibi and evidence proving his innocence, explain how the legal process should proceed differently.\n\nYour response must have exactly 4 sections, separated by the markdown divider: ***.", "response": "When a suspect presents a solid alibi and concrete evidence of innocence early in the investigation, law enforcement must immediately pivot from building a case against him to verifying the exculpatory evidence. This includes corroborating the alibi through independent sources\u2014such as cross-referencing surveillance footage, cell phone location data, witness statements from neutral third parties, or transaction records that place him miles away from the crime scene at the time of the offense. Investigators should suspend all targeted actions, like search warrants, surveillance, or witness interviews focused on implicating him, and instead redirect resources to identifying actual suspects. If he was taken into temporary custody, he should be released promptly, as a credible alibi eliminates any reasonable suspicion of guilt and negates flight risk.\n\n***\n\nDuring the pre-charge phase, prosecutors have a legal and ethical duty to prioritize exculpatory evidence over pursuing charges. Upon receiving the suspect\u2019s alibi and innocence proof, they must conduct a rigorous, unbiased review to confirm the evidence\u2019s authenticity and irrelevance to the crime. If the alibi is irrefutable\u2014for example, timestamped airport records showing he was out of the country when the offense occurred\u2014prosecutors should decline to file charges entirely. If the suspect was already indicted by mistake, prosecutors may move to dismiss the case before trial to avoid wasting judicial resources. Additionally, if the suspect was held in pre-trial custody, prosecutors should advocate for his immediate release without bail, as there is no legitimate basis to detain someone with clear proof of innocence.\n\n***\n\nIf charges were mistakenly filed despite the alibi and innocence evidence, the defense should file a motion to dismiss with prejudice, citing lack of probable cause and overwhelming exculpatory proof. The court will hold an evidentiary hearing where the defense presents tangible evidence\u2014such as sworn witness testimony placing the suspect at a family event, or forensic evidence excluding him from the crime scene. Since the prosecution cannot rebut this evidence, the judge must grant the motion, which bars any future prosecution for the same offense. Following dismissal, the defense can petition the court to expunge all arrest and charge records, ensuring the suspect does not face collateral consequences like difficulty securing employment or housing due to a wrongful criminal record.\n\n***\n\nAfter the case is resolved in the suspect\u2019s favor, systemic and individual remedies are critical to address harm and prevent repeat errors. The wrongfully targeted individual may be eligible for state or federal compensation for any time spent in custody, lost wages, or emotional distress. Law enforcement agencies should conduct an internal review to identify gaps in the initial investigation\u2014such as reliance on flawed witness identification or failure to pursue exculpatory leads\u2014and implement training to correct these issues. Prosecutorial offices should update their protocols to require mandatory documentation and review of all exculpatory evidence early in the process. Finally, the suspect may access counseling or financial support services to mitigate the personal and professional toll of being wrongfully accused."}

MANY NIKE SNEAKER MODELS FEATURE REINFORCED RUBBER OUTSOLES THAT RESIST WEAR FROM PAVEMENT, SIDEWALKS, AND EVEN LIGHT TRAILS, MAKING THEM IDEAL FOR DAILY COMMUTING OR EXTENDED WALKS. THE UPPERS OF A NIKE SNEAKER OFTEN USE HEAVY-DUTY CANVAS, SYNTHETIC BLENDS, OR DURABLE MESH THAT WITHSTANDS SCUFFS, TEARS, AND FADING BETTER THAN DELICATE MATERIALS. STITCHED SEAMS RATHER THAN GLUED JOINTS IN CRITICAL AREAS OF A NIKE SNEAKER PREVENT SEPARATION OVER MONTHS OF REGULAR USE, EVEN WHEN EXPOSED TO WET CONDITIONS OR FREQUENT CLEANING.\n\nIN CONTRAST, PRADA SNEAKERS PRIORITIZE LUXURY MATERIALS OVER RUGGED DURABILITY. MOST PRADA SNEAKER STYLES UTILIZE FULL-GRAIN LEATHER UPPERS, WHILE BEING PREMIUM, ARE PRONE TO SCRATCHES, CREASING, AND COLOR FADING IF NOT CARED FOR PROPERLY. THE OUTSOLES OF A PRADA SNEAKER ARE OFTEN SLIMMER AND MADE FROM SOFTER RUBBER OR EVEN LEATHER, WHICH WEARS DOWN MORE QUICKLY WITH CONSTANT PAVEMENT CONTACT. GLUED SEAMS IN SOME PRADA SNEAKER DESIGNS CAN ALSO BECOME UNDONE IF SUBJECTED TO ROUGH TREATMENT, SUCH AS RUNNING OVER CURBS OR WEARING THE SNEAKER IN HEAVY RAIN WITHOUT PROTECTION.\n\nTURNING TO COMFORT: NIKE SNEAKERS ARE DESIGNED FOR INSTANT, ALL-DAY COMFORT. MANY NIKE SNEAKER STYLES INCORPORATE BREATHABLE MESH UPPERS THAT ALLOW AIR CIRCULATION, PREVENTING FEET FROM GETTING SWEATY OR FATIGUED DURING LONG HOURS OF WEAR.

{"prompt": "Please explain why China has experienced so many periods of division and unification throughout its history.\n\nYour response must use the word \"war\" at least 8 times, and the word \"peace\" at least 10 times.", "response": "China\u2019s long history of division and unification is a complex tapestry woven from the interplay of cultural identity, economic necessity, political ambition, and the eternal tension between war and peace. To understand these cycles, we must examine how war disrupts unity, how peace fosters integration, and how the memory of one drives the pursuit of the other.\n\nWhen peace prevails for extended periods, it nurtures economic growth, cultural cohesion, and shared prosperity. The Han Dynasty\u2019s four centuries of relative peace, for example, solidified a common sense of \u201cChinese\u201d identity, standardized writing and laws, and built infrastructure that connected distant regions. But over time, political corruption, regional inequality, and external pressures can fracture this peace. The Han\u2019s collapse ignited the Three Kingdoms era, where war raged across every province, pitting warlords against each other in endless conflict. Each war in this period eroded central authority, yet the collective memory of peace under a unified empire kept alive the unshakable desire for reunification.\n\nGeographic factors amplify these cycles: the fertile river valleys of the Yellow and Yangtze form a natural economic core, but mountainous border regions and vast steppes can resist central control. When a central government fails to maintain peace, regional rulers or warlords may seize power, splitting the country into rival states. But the need to coordinate water management, protect trade routes, and defend against nomadic invaders often pulls regions back toward unification. Only a unified state can ensure the long-term peace needed to manage these shared challenges\u2014without it, war over scarce resources or border security becomes inevitable.\n\nCultural unity acts as a powerful anchor even in the darkest times of war. Confucian values, which emphasize harmony, hierarchy, and a unified \u201call-under-heaven\u201d realm, permeate every layer of society. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, war split the country along the Yangtze River for nearly 300 years, but scholars continued to teach shared texts, artisans preserved common artistic traditions, and merchants traded across battle lines. These ties kept the dream of peace and unification alive, even as war destroyed cities and displaced millions.\n\nThe cycle repeats: unification brings peace, peace fosters growth, growth leads to decay, decay sparks war, war fuels the desire for peace, and peace drives reunification. The Sui Dynasty\u2019s unification ended the Northern and Southern Dynasties\u2019 chaos, but its reckless pursuit of war\u2014including costly campaigns against Korea\u2014shattered the peace it had forged, leading to its rapid collapse. The Tang Dynasty that followed restored peace, creating a golden age of cultural flourishing and global influence. Yet when the Tang weakened, war between regional warlords erupted again, plunging the country into the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Every war in this era deepened the populace\u2019s yearning for peace, and when the Song Dynasty emerged, it reclaimed most of the land, restoring a fragile peace that lasted for centuries\u2014until external wars with the Liao, Jin, and Mongol forces once again split the country.\n\nExternal threats also push divided regions toward unification. When nomadic tribes launch war on borderlands, fragmented states often lack the military strength to defend their people, making peace impossible. The Ming Dynasty\u2019s rise followed the end of Mongol rule, as Zhu Yuanzhang led a rebellion to end the war and chaos, restoring peace and a unified Han-led empire. Even during the Qing Dynasty\u2019s expansion, the need to end war with regional rebels and external powers drove efforts to consolidate control, ensuring peace across a vast territory.\n\nIn every cycle, war is a temporary disruption, but peace is the enduring goal. The shared memory of peace under unified empires, combined with cultural, economic, and geographic imperatives, ensures that division is never permanent. Each war that tears the land apart only strengthens the resolve to rebuild peace and unity, making China\u2019s history a testament to the unbreakable link between conflict and harmony."}

{"prompt": "Describe the aroma and appearance of eucalyptus trees in vivid detail. Offer suggestions on how to incorporate eucalyptus into daily life.\n\nYour response must be at least 350 words long.", "response": "Standing beneath a mature eucalyptus tree is like stepping into a living, breathing sanctuary\u2014one that engages every sense with its striking appearance and intoxicating aroma. Let\u2019s begin with its visual allure: eucalyptus trees are a study in contrasts, their bark a patchwork of peeling layers that reveal hues ranging from warm cinnamon to soft cream and weathered gray. The bark doesn\u2019t just fall off in chunks; it curls away in delicate, papery strips, like discarded silk scarves caught on rough branches, giving the trunk a textured, almost sculptural quality. The leaves, too, evolve dramatically: juvenile leaves are round, fuzzy, and a muted blue-green, clinging to young branches like tiny, soft coins. As the tree matures, the leaves stretch into long, lance-shaped blades with a glossy, silvery sheen, hanging downward in graceful clusters that sway gently in the wind, catching sunlight to cast dappled patterns on the ground below. In spring, hidden among the foliage, you\u2019ll spot clusters of creamy white flowers\u2014fluffy, pom-pom-like blooms that attract bees with their subtle sweetness, adding a delicate counterpoint to the tree\u2019s bold structure.\n\nNow, the aroma: it\u2019s impossible to ignore. Crush a single adult leaf between your fingers, and a burst of crisp, camphoraceous scent explodes forth\u2014cool, slightly sweet, with undertones of pine and wild honey. It\u2019s not a cloying fragrance; instead, it feels like inhaling a mountain breeze after a rainstorm, sharp and clean, cutting through stale air and clearing your sinuses instantly. On rainy days, the tree releases its scent in waves: raindrops hit the leaves, releasing essential oils into the air, turning the surrounding area into a natural aromatherapy session. Even from a distance, the scent lingers, a quiet reminder of the tree\u2019s presence.\n\nIncorporating eucalyptus into daily life is a wonderful way to bring this natural magic indoors and enhance your well-being. For home decor, fresh eucalyptus bundles are a game-changer: tie a few branches together with twine and hang them in your shower. The steam from hot water will activate the essential oils, filling the bathroom with that invigorating scent and turning your daily shower into a spa-like retreat. Alternatively, place a bundle in a tall vase on your dining table, where its silvery leaves add a touch of understated elegance to any meal. Dried eucalyptus wreaths or garlands are perfect for doorways or wall decor, their muted green tones complementing both modern and rustic interiors, and their lingering scent acting as a natural air freshener.\n\nFor personal care, eucalyptus essential oil is a versatile staple. Add a few drops to a diffuser in your living room to clear the air after a long day, or in your bedroom to promote relaxation and better sleep (its calming properties help ease stress, while its decongestant qualities ensure you breathe easy through the night). You can also mix eucalyptus oil with coconut oil and sugar to create a homemade body scrub: the sugar exfoliates dead skin, the coconut oil moisturizes, and the eucalyptus leaves you feeling refreshed and smelling like a forest. For a quick pick-me-up, add a drop of eucalyptus oil to your palm, rub your hands together, and inhale deeply\u2014ideal for midday slumps or when you need to focus.\n\nWellness enthusiasts will appreciate eucalyptus\u2019s medicinal benefits. For sinus congestion or a stuffy nose, try steam inhalation: boil a pot of water, add a few drops of eucalyptus oil, lean over the pot with a towel draped over your head, and inhale the steam for 5-10 minutes. The essential oils will break up mucus and soothe irritated airways. You can also create a natural pillow spray by mixing 10 drops of eucalyptus oil with 2 ounces of water and a teaspoon of vodka (to help the oil mix). Spritz it on your pillowcases before bed to enjoy a restful night\u2019s sleep.\n\nIn the kitchen, eucalyptus can add a unique twist to your culinary creations\u2014though it\u2019s important to note that only certain varieties, like Eucalyptus globulus or Eucalyptus citriodora, are safe for consumption. Young, tender leaves can be used as a garnish for cocktails (try adding a sprig to a gin and tonic for a fresh, herbaceous kick) or infused into honey: place a few leaves in a jar of raw honey, let it sit for a week, and drizzle the eucalyptus-infused honey over yogurt, oatmeal, or tea for a subtle, earthy sweetness.\n\nFor gardeners, planting eucalyptus in your yard (if your climate allows\u2014they thrive in warm, sunny areas with well-drained soil) not only adds beauty but also repels mosquitoes and other pests, thanks to its strong scent. If you don\u2019t have outdoor space, a small potted eucalyptus plant near a sunny window will thrive, providing you with fresh leaves year-round for all your DIY projects.\n\nWhether you\u2019re using it to freshen your home, soothe your body, or add a touch of nature to your meals, eucalyptus is a versatile, sensory-rich plant that brings the calm of the outdoors into your daily routine. Its ability to engage both sight and smell makes it more than just a decorative plant\u2014it\u2019s a tool for enhancing your overall well-being, one crisp, invigorating scent at a time."}

{"prompt": "Analyze the reasons behind the distinct sentiments of the Croatian and Serbian nations towards the Austrian Empire at the end of the 19th century, considering their historical contexts, cultural identities, and political aspirations.\n\nYour response must be wrapped with double quotes. Your response must use at least 800 words.", "response": "\"By the end of the 19th century, the Croatian and Serbian nations held starkly contrasting sentiments toward the Austrian Empire (and its successor, the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy after 1867). These differences were not arbitrary but rooted in centuries of divergent historical experiences, conflicting cultural identities, and competing political aspirations\u2014factors that would ultimately shape the Balkan crisis of the early 20th century and contribute to the outbreak of World War I.\n\n### Historical Context: Alliance vs. Adversity\nThe foundation of Croatia\u2019s relationship with the Habsburgs was forged in mutual survival. In 1527, after the Ottoman Empire conquered most of Croatia\u2019s territory, the remaining Croatian estates voluntarily swore allegiance to the Austrian Habsburgs, viewing them as the only power capable of halting Ottoman expansion. For over three centuries, this alliance defined Croatian history: Habsburg military support defended Croatia\u2019s remaining lands, and in return, Croatia remained a loyal component of the empire. Even as the Ottomans retreated in the 18th and 19th centuries, Croatia retained its ties to Austria, seeing the empire as a bulwark against both residual Ottoman threats and the growing dominance of neighboring Hungary. The 1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise, which established the Dual Monarchy, placed Croatia under Hungarian jurisdiction, but this only deepened Croatia\u2019s pragmatic reliance on Austria: when Hungary imposed harsh Magyarization policies\u2014forcing the Hungarian language on schools, courts, and administration\u2014Croatian leaders turned to Vienna to mediate and protect their autonomy. This history of shared struggle and pragmatic alliance left Croatians with a sentiment of cautious loyalty, viewing Austria not as an oppressor but as a necessary partner in safeguarding their existence.\n\nSerbia\u2019s historical experience with Austria, by contrast, was marked by rivalry and resentment. For most of the early modern period, Serbia was under Ottoman rule, but its brief occupation by Austria in the 1718\u20131739 Treaty of Belgrade left a legacy of mistrust. When Serbia gained autonomy from the Ottomans in 1815 and full independence at the 1878 Berlin Conference, its emergence as a sovereign state coincided with Austria-Hungary\u2019s aggressive expansion in the Balkans. The Dual Monarchy\u2019s occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1878\u2014territory with a large Serbian population and deep cultural ties to Serbia\u2014was a direct affront to Serbian nationalist ambitions. Austria-Hungary\u2019s subsequent economic dominance, including high tariffs on Serbian agricultural exports (such as pigs, a cornerstone of Serbia\u2019s economy), further strained relations. Unlike Croatia, Serbia had no history of relying on Austria for protection; instead, it saw the empire as a predatory power blocking its path to uniting all Serb-inhabited lands into a single state.\n\n### Cultural Identity: Alignment vs. Alienation\nCultural and religious divides amplified the divergent sentiments. Croatia\u2019s cultural identity was deeply aligned with Austria\u2019s Western European, Catholic orientation. Croatians are predominantly Catholic, use the Latin alphabet, and their national revival in the 19th century\u2014the Illyrian Movement\u2014focused on linguistic and cultural autonomy within the Habsburg framework rather than secession. The movement\u2019s leaders, such as Ljudevit Gaj, advocated for a unified South Slavic language and culture but viewed the empire as a safe space to nurture these goals, given its shared Catholic faith and commitment to Western European norms. The Croatian Catholic Church, a central pillar of national identity, maintained close ties to the Habsburg state, reinforcing the sense of shared values.\n\nSerbia, by contrast, was rooted in Eastern Orthodox tradition, using the Cyrillic alphabet and maintaining strong cultural and religious ties to Russia. Serbian nationalism was inextricably linked to Orthodox identity, with the Serbian Orthodox Church playing a pivotal role in fostering national consciousness. The memory of the medieval Serbian Empire (14th century) and the struggle against Ottoman oppression shaped a narrative of Serbia as the \u201cliberator\u201d of South Slavs from foreign rule. This narrative directly clashed with Austria-Hungary\u2019s status as a Catholic imperial power controlling Slavic lands like Bosnia-Herzegovina and parts of Croatia. Serbian nationalists viewed Austria as a foreign occupier that suppressed Orthodox Slavic culture, and they looked to Russia as their natural ally against Habsburg dominance. This cultural alienation turned anti-Austrian sentiment into a core component of Serbian national identity.\n\n### Political Aspirations: Autonomy vs. Unification\nThe most profound divide lay in the nations\u2019 political goals. For Croatia, the primary aspiration was not independence but greater autonomy within the Austro-Hungarian framework. After the 1868 Nagodba (compromise) with Hungary, Croatia gained control over education, religion, and local administration, but it remained frustrated by Hungarian attempts to erode its cultural and political rights. Croatian nationalists, including figures like Ante Star\u010devi\u0107, initially advocated for a \u201ctrialist\u201d solution: transforming the Dual Monarchy into a Triple Monarchy with equal status for Austria, Hungary, and a unified South Slav state (encompassing Croatia, Slovenia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina). This vision was compatible with Habsburg rule, as it sought to reform rather than dismantle the empire. Croatians feared that independence would leave them vulnerable to Hungarian or Serbian domination, so they prioritized working within the imperial system to protect their interests.\n\nSerbia\u2019s political aspirations, however, were fundamentally incompatible with Austro-Hungarian rule. Serbian nationalists championed Yugoslavism\u2014the idea of uniting all South Slavs into a single state, with Serbia as its natural leader. This irredentist vision included claims to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vojvodina (a Habsburg province with a large Serbian population), and parts of Croatia. Austria-Hungary\u2019s control over these lands made it the primary obstacle to Serbia\u2019s nationalist goals. The 1885 Serbo-Bulgarian War, where Austria-Hungary intervened to force Serbia to accept the status quo after its failed invasion of Bulgaria, reinforced the perception that Austria was determined to contain Serbian power. By the late 19th century, Serbian nationalism had become increasingly radicalized, with groups like the Chetniks launching guerrilla attacks in Bosnia-Herzegovina against Austro-Hungarian rule. For Serbs, Austria was not a partner but an enemy standing in the way of their national destiny.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy the end of the 19th century, Croatia\u2019s sentiment toward Austria-Hungary was one of pragmatic loyalty, shaped by centuries of alliance, cultural alignment, and a desire for autonomy within the imperial framework. Serbia, by contrast, viewed the empire with bitter hostility, driven by competing territorial ambitions, cultural alienation, and a nationalist agenda that demanded the unification of all South Slavs outside Habsburg control. These contrasting sentiments were not just theoretical; they would erupt into open conflict with the 1908 annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the 1914 assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, triggering World War I. The divide between Croatian pragmatism and Serbian radicalism reflected deeper tensions in the Balkans\u2014tensions that would define the region\u2019s history for decades to come.\""}

{"prompt": "Provide tips for managing time effectively as a parent without sacrificing quality time with your child, but do not mention seeking external help or support.\n\nAvoid using the following keywords: sleep, cook, feed. Mention the keyword 'schedule' more than 5 times.", "response": "Managing time effectively as a parent while nurturing meaningful connections with your child hinges on intentional, child-centered planning\u2014all centered around a thoughtful schedule that works for both of you. Here are actionable tips to make this happen:\n\n1. Co-design a visual schedule with your child. Sit down together to map out daily activities, using colorful stickers or drawings to mark blocks for your tasks, their playtime, and shared moments. This collaborative schedule not only gives your child a sense of ownership but also ensures the schedule reflects their needs and interests. When your child feels invested in the schedule, they\u2019re more likely to respect the boundaries it sets, making it easier for you to stay on track with both tasks and quality time. Revisit this schedule each morning to go over the day\u2019s plan, so everyone is on the same page about what the schedule holds.\n\n2. Build your schedule around non-negotiable quality time blocks first. Instead of fitting in time with your child after all tasks are done, prioritize these moments by slotting them into your schedule as the foundation of your day. Whether it\u2019s a 20-minute block for playing a board game or a 45-minute window for exploring the backyard, marking these as fixed entries in your schedule ensures they never get pushed aside by last-minute tasks. The schedule should treat these moments as just as important as any work deadline or household chore, so you don\u2019t sacrifice connection for productivity.\n\n3. Use micro-schedule blocks to tackle quick, high-impact tasks. Identify small, focused tasks that can be completed in 10 to 15 minutes\u2014like sorting laundry, replying to urgent messages, or tidying up the play area\u2014and assign them to gaps in your schedule where your child is engaged in independent play. For example, if your child is happily drawing, a micro-schedule block for folding clothes can fit seamlessly into the schedule without disrupting their flow or your quality time later. Labeling these micro-schedule blocks clearly in your schedule helps you stay focused and avoid overextending yourself into time that should be reserved for your child.\n\n4. Batch similar tasks to optimize your schedule and free up more shared time. Group tasks that require the same mindset or space\u2014like organizing paperwork or sorting through toys\u2014and assign them to longer, uninterrupted blocks in your schedule when your child is occupied with a self-directed activity, such as watching an educational show or building with Legos. Batching tasks reduces the mental load of switching between activities, making your schedule more efficient and leaving you with more energy for the quality time blocks in your schedule. Be sure to check your schedule regularly to adjust these batch blocks if your child\u2019s attention span shifts, ensuring the schedule continues to support both your productivity and your bond.\n\n5. Review and refine your schedule weekly to keep it aligned with both your needs and your child\u2019s evolving interests. A schedule that worked perfectly last week might not fit this week, especially if your child has a new favorite activity or a change in their play patterns. Set aside 15 minutes each Sunday to look over your current schedule, note what worked (like the afternoon schedule block for nature walks) and what didn\u2019t (like a morning schedule block for bill-paying that clashed with your child\u2019s need for attention), and adjust the schedule accordingly. This regular check-in ensures your schedule remains a flexible tool that supports both productivity and connection, rather than a rigid rulebook that adds stress.\n\n6. Turn routine transitions into shared moments that fit naturally into your schedule. For example, the schedule block for walking to the neighborhood park can double as a time to play \u201cI Spy\u201d or chat about their favorite cartoon character, merging a chance to get outside with quality interaction. By weaving these small, meaningful exchanges into the existing flow of your schedule, you don\u2019t have to carve out extra time for connection\u2014it becomes an integral part of the schedule itself. This approach makes every minute of your schedule count, whether you\u2019re checking off a task or bonding with your child over a silly joke or a curious observation about the world around you."}
{"prompt": "Justify the following statement:\nIf you have a dime, consider donating it to a charitable cause. However, if you want to save it for future needs, place it in a secure location.\n\nYour response must have at least 600 words.", "response": "The statement urging individuals to either donate a dime to charity or save it securely for future needs is far more than trivial advice; it is a distillation of financial wisdom, ethical mindfulness, and respect for the nuance of human circumstance. A dime, often dismissed as an insignificant unit of currency, serves as a microcosm of the larger choices we make about resource allocation\u2014choices that reflect our values, our sense of responsibility to ourselves and others, and our understanding of how small acts accumulate into meaningful change. The statement\u2019s power lies not in prescribing a single \"right\" path, but in encouraging intentionality: rather than letting the dime slip through the cracks of loose pockets or mindless purchases, it invites us to assign purpose to even the smallest financial resource.\n\nTo begin, donating a dime to a charitable cause is an act of profound ethical and social significance, justified by both its immediate symbolic value and its long-term collective impact. At first glance, a dime may seem too modest to make a difference, but this perspective overlooks the transformative power of micro-philanthropy. Consider the UNICEF \"Change for Good\" campaign, which collects spare change from airline passengers. Millions of dimes, quarters, and pennies donated by travelers have funded life-saving vaccines, clean water projects, and school supplies for children in low-income countries. A single dime might not buy a full vaccine dose, but when combined with millions of others, it contributes to a system that immunizes thousands of children against preventable diseases. Locally, a dime can add up to a meal for a homeless person at a community food bank: many food banks report that $1 can provide three meals, meaning a dime covers a third of a meal\u2014enough to ease hunger for someone in need.\n\nBeyond tangible impact, donating a dime is an act of solidarity. For individuals who may feel powerless to address large-scale social issues like poverty or inequality, giving a dime is a way to reject helplessness and declare, \"I care, and I am part of the solution.\" This gesture cultivates a culture of generosity, where small acts of giving become habitual rather than occasional. Ethically, this aligns with utilitarian principles, which prioritize actions that maximize overall well-being: directing a dime to someone in greater need creates more happiness than spending it on a trivial luxury like a piece of candy or a single gumdrop. Psychologically, studies from positive psychology confirm that even small acts of prosocial behavior boost the donor\u2019s mood and sense of purpose. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Positive Psychology found that people who gave as little as $5 to charity reported higher levels of life satisfaction than those who kept the money\u2014and the same logic applies to dimes, as the act of giving, not the amount, is the key driver of this benefit. Donating a dime also breaks down the barrier of \"I don\u2019t have enough to give,\" a common excuse that prevents many from engaging in philanthropy. By normalizing small donations, it encourages people to integrate giving into their daily lives, regardless of their financial status.\n\nOn the other hand, saving the dime in a secure location is equally justified, as it reflects a commitment to personal financial resilience and long-term well-being\u2014especially for those facing economic vulnerability. For individuals living paycheck to paycheck, every dime is a building block of financial security. A 2022 survey by the Federal Reserve found that 37% of U.S. adults would struggle to cover a $400 emergency expense. For these individuals, saving a dime today could be part of a fund that eventually covers a bus fare to get to work, a replacement light bulb for a home, or a small portion of a prescription medication. Over time, consistent small savings add up: if someone saves one dime a day, they accumulate $36.50 in a year, which can be used to buy groceries or pay a utility bill.\n\nBehavioral economics helps explain why this matters: the concept of \"mental accounting\" suggests that earmarking dimes for a specific savings goal (like an emergency fund) helps people avoid impulse spending, while the \"power of compounding\"\u2014even at low interest rates\u2014means that small amounts grow over time. For example, saving $0.10 a day in a savings account with a 2% annual interest rate would yield over $40 in five years, with minimal effort. The emphasis on a \"secure location\" is also critical: keeping dimes in a locked piggy bank, a dedicated savings jar, or a low-fee savings account prevents loss, theft, or mindless spending. For children, a secure piggy bank is a tangible tool to learn financial discipline, teaching them that delayed gratification leads to greater rewards. For adults, a secure location for small savings reinforces the habit of intentional resource management, breaking the cycle of living paycheck to paycheck by building a small buffer against unexpected crises. This act of saving is not selfish; it is an act of self-care and responsibility. When individuals are financially stable, they are better able to contribute to their communities in the long run\u2014someone who can cover their own emergency expenses is less likely to rely on public assistance, freeing up resources for others.\n\nWhat makes the original statement so wise is its recognition that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It does not pit community responsibility against personal well-being; instead, it honors the diversity of human circumstances. A person with a stable income and a robust emergency fund may choose to donate the dime, as the marginal benefit to themselves is negligible compared to the benefit to someone in need. A person struggling to make ends meet, however, may prioritize saving the dime as a step toward financial security. In either case, the statement encourages intentionality: rather than letting the dime be lost or spent on something meaningless, it invites us to assign purpose to every resource. This intentionality is the foundation of both ethical living and financial literacy. Too often, we overlook small amounts of money, assuming they are not worth our attention, but the dime reminds us that every dollar is made of ten dimes\u2014and every dime is a choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement to either donate a dime to charity or save it securely is a testament to the power of small, intentional actions. Donating the dime fosters solidarity, collective impact, and personal well-being through prosocial behavior. Saving the dime builds financial resilience, discipline, and a buffer against life\u2019s uncertainties. Both choices are acts of responsibility: one to the community, one to oneself. The dime, once dismissed as insignificant, becomes a mirror reflecting our values and priorities. By guiding us to choose purpose over neglect, the statement offers a timeless lesson in how to live mindfully, one dime at a time."}
{"prompt": "Provide a detailed comparison of salmon and avocado on their nutritional values, culinary uses, and environmental impacts.\n\nYour response should contain some words in all caps, but those all-caps words should appear at most 10 times.", "response": "### Nutritional Values\nSalmon and avocado are nutrient-dense staples, but their profiles cater to distinct dietary needs.  \nSalmon, a fatty cold-water fish, is a powerhouse of OMEGA-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA)\u2014essential nutrients that support brain function, reduce chronic inflammation, and lower heart disease risk. A 100-gram serving of cooked salmon delivers ~20 grams of complete protein (containing all 9 essential amino acids), plus significant doses of vitamin D (critical for bone health and immune function), vitamin B12 (for nerve and red blood cell health), and selenium (a potent antioxidant).  \nAvocado, a creamy stone fruit, stands out for its high content of MONOUNSATURATED FATS (oleic acid), which help lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and support cardiovascular health. A 100-gram serving has ~15 grams of healthy fats, 2 grams of protein, and is rich in fiber (7 grams), potassium (more than a banana), vitamin K (for blood clotting and bone health), and vitamin C. It\u2019s a go-to for plant-based eaters seeking to boost fat intake without animal products.\n\n### Culinary Uses\nBoth ingredients are incredibly versatile, but they bring unique flavors and textures to dishes.  \nSalmon\u2019s savory, slightly buttery taste works across casual and fine dining: grilled with lemon and dill for a weeknight meal, smoked for bagels or grain salads, raw as sashimi or nigiri in sushi, or flaked into tacos or pasta. Its umami depth pairs perfectly with acidic (lemon, vinegar) or herbaceous (dill, cilantro) components to cut through its richness.  \nAvocado\u2019s mild, nutty flavor and velvety texture make it a multi-purpose workhorse. It\u2019s most famous as the star of guacamole, but also shines on toast, in green smoothies, as a dairy-free spread, or sliced into salads for extra creaminess. It\u2019s even used as a substitute for butter or mayo in baking to add moisture without saturated fats. In sushi, it balances the umami of fish or vegetables in maki rolls, and its neutral taste makes it a flexible addition to both sweet and savory recipes.\n\n### Environmental Impacts\nBoth salmon and avocado have notable environmental footprints, though their core challenges differ.  \nFor salmon, OVERFISHING of wild stocks is a critical concern, particularly in Pacific regions where dams and climate change have damaged spawning habitats, reducing natural populations. Farmed salmon, while more widely available, poses risks like water pollution (from excess feed, waste, and antibiotics), escaped fish competing with wild salmon for resources, and reliance on other fish for feed (a highly inefficient process, as it takes 2\u20135 pounds of wild fish to produce 1 pound of farmed salmon).  \nAvocado production\u2019s biggest issue is WATER SCARCITY: a single avocado requires roughly 272 liters of water to grow, putting immense strain on arid regions like Mexico\u2019s Michoac\u00e1n (the world\u2019s top producer). Deforestation to expand avocado orchards also threatens biodiversity, destroying habitats for species like jaguars and monarch butterflies.  \nThe good news is that SUSTAINABLE CERTIFICATIONS exist for both: look for MSC-certified wild salmon or BAP-certified farmed salmon, and Rainforest Alliance or Fair Trade-certified avocados to support more responsible production."}

The core objectives are to identify key lexical syntactic and pragmatic shifts across generations to map links between these shifts and external influences such as social media or cultural norms and to explore how intergenerational interactions shape the adoption or rejection of altered linguistic practices.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from a single urban US region to minimize regional linguistic variation. Three groups will be formed Generation Z (ages 18 to 25) Millennials (30 to 45) and Baby Boomers (65 to 80). Each group will include 100 participants with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds and educational levels to ensure the sample reflects broad social diversity within each generation. Exclusion criteria include non native English speakers and individuals who have lived outside the target region for more than 10 consecutive years.\n\nData collection will occur over three months and include two primary types of data. First spontaneous speech samples will be gathered by asking participants to complete two 10 minute conversations one with a peer from their own generation and one with a participant from a different generation. These conversations will be recorded and transcribed for analysis. Second written samples will be collected including a 500 word personal narrative about a recent meaningful event and three examples of casual written exchanges such as text messages or social media posts.\n\nFor data analysis researchers will use qualitative and quantitative methods to identify patterns. Lexical shifts will be tracked by counting frequency of neologisms and outdated terms across groups. Syntactic shifts will be analyzed by examining sentence structure including use of fragmented sentences subject omission and verb tense consistency. Pragmatic shifts will be assessed by looking at turn taking patterns use of intensifiers and degree of directness in requests or statements.\n\nEthical protocols will be strictly followed including obtaining informed consent from all participants anonymizing all collected data and allowing participants to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. The study timeline spans 12 months with two months for recruitment and ethical approval three months for data collection five months for analysis and two months for report writing and sharing findings with academic and public audiences.\n\nExpected findings include that lexical shifts will be the most dramatic with Generation Z using terms tied to digital culture that are largely unfamiliar to Baby Boomers. Syntactic shifts will be subtler but noticeable in casual speech where younger generations may use more fragmented or elliptical structures. Pragmatic shifts may show that younger speakers are more direct in casual interactions while older speakers prefer more indirect phrasing. Additionally intergenerational conversations may reveal that speakers adjust their linguistic style to align with the other generation indicating some level of adaptive learning rather than strict rejection of differing norms. This study will contribute to our understanding of how language evolves across time and how social factors drive these shifts without relying on intergroup evaluations that might oversimplify complex linguistic dynamics. It will also provide insights into how technological and cultural forces shape everyday language use across different age groups and how these shifts are transmitted or resisted between generations."}

{"prompt": "Provide advice on how to market the business that I want to start.\n\nYour response should avoid mentioning the word \"photography\". Your response should contain exactly 5 paragraphs, separated by 3 asterisk symbols ***. Your response should highlight at least three sections with markdown, such as *highlighted section*.", "response": "To effectively market your new business, start with *Hyper-targeted audience segmentation* that goes beyond basic demographics. Instead of just targeting \"young homeowners,\" dig into psychographics\u2014identify people who prioritize unique, purpose-built items over mass-produced alternatives, or those who value supporting small, independent creators. Use social media listening tools to track conversations in online communities where your target audience gathers, noting their pain points (like struggling to find pieces that fit their specific style) and aspirations (like creating a home that reflects their personality). Craft detailed buyer personas based on this data, then tailor every marketing message to speak directly to their needs and desires, ensuring your brand feels personal and relevant.\n\n***\n\nNext, build trust and engagement through *Story-driven, value-first content* that positions your business as more than just a seller. Create content that educates, inspires, or entertains, rather than solely promoting products. For example, share behind-the-scenes videos of your creation process to highlight craftsmanship, post customer stories about how your items enhanced their daily lives, or publish blog posts with tips for integrating your products into their routines. Use platforms where your audience is most active\u2014like Instagram Reels for visual storytelling, Pinterest for curated inspiration boards, or a blog for in-depth guides. By focusing on value, you\u2019ll attract followers who are genuinely interested in your brand, not just quick purchases.\n\n***\n\nLeverage *Micro-influencer and local business collaborations* to expand your reach with authentic, trusted audiences. Micro-influencers (10,000 to 50,000 followers) often have higher engagement rates than larger creators because their followers see them as relatable peers. Partner with those whose values align with your brand\u2014whether that\u2019s sustainability, craftsmanship, or minimalist design\u2014and ask them to share honest reviews or showcase your products in their daily lives. Locally, collaborate with complementary businesses like boutique cafes, home decor shops, or wellness studios for pop-up events or cross-promotions. For example, a joint giveaway with a local coffee shop could expose your brand to their regular customers, who are likely to share your target audience\u2019s preferences.\n\n***\n\nCultivate long-term customer loyalty to turn first-time buyers into brand advocates. Implement a tiered loyalty program where customers earn points for purchases, social media shares, and referrals. Offer tiered rewards like early access to new collections, exclusive discounts, or free customizations for top-tier members. Encourage user-generated content by tagging customers who post about your products and featuring their photos on your website and social media channels\u2014this not only makes customers feel valued but also provides social proof for potential buyers. You can also launch a referral program where both the referrer and new customer receive a discount, turning word-of-mouth into a measurable, scalable strategy.\n\n***\n\nFinally, use data-driven optimization to refine your marketing efforts over time. Track key metrics like website traffic sources, social media engagement rates, conversion rates, and customer retention rates using tools like Google Analytics or social media insights. Identify which channels and content types perform best\u2014for example, if Pinterest drives 60% of your website traffic, allocate more resources to creating high-quality, visually appealing pins. Conduct regular customer surveys to gather feedback on your marketing messages, product offerings, and overall brand experience. Use this data to adjust your strategy, test new approaches, and ensure your marketing efforts stay aligned with your audience\u2019s evolving needs and preferences."}

{"prompt": "Provide an overview of the traditional processing methods used for Yemeni coffee.\n\nYour response should include an outline with at least 15 sections highlighted with markdown such as *highlighted section*.", "response": "Yemen\u2019s coffee processing is deeply rooted in centuries of tradition, shaped by its arid climate, limited water resources, and rich cultural heritage. Unlike many global coffee regions that rely on washed processing, Yemeni farmers primarily use natural (dry) methods, with unique local variations that yield the coffee\u2019s signature fruity, wine-like flavors. Below is a detailed overview of the traditional processing steps:\n\n1. *Selective Handpicking of Ripe Cherries*  \nYemeni coffee cherries are harvested exclusively by hand, a labor-intensive practice that prioritizes only fully ripe, deep-red cherries. Farmers traverse terraced mountain farms to select cherries at peak sugar content, as unripe green cherries would introduce sour, underdeveloped notes to the final brew.\n\n2. *On-Farm Initial Sorting*  \nImmediately after picking, farmers sort cherries manually on woven mats to separate ripe specimens from unripe (green), overripe (dark brown), or damaged (split, pest-eaten) cherries. This step prevents mold growth during drying by removing cherries that could spoil the entire batch.\n\n3. *Sun-Drying on Raised Madbakh Mats*  \nThe most iconic drying method uses madbakh\u2014elevated, woven palm-leaf mats that allow air to circulate beneath the cherries. Raising the mats off the ground avoids contact with damp soil, reduces mold risk, and ensures even airflow, which preserves delicate fruity flavors.\n\n4. *Manual Turning and Raking for Uniform Drying*  \nFarmers or family members turn cherries 2\u20133 times daily using wooden rakes or their hands. This prevents clumping, ensures all sides are exposed to sunlight, and minimizes mold formation in dense, damp areas. Turning frequency increases during humid periods to maintain quality.\n\n5. *Moisture Content Monitoring*  \nThroughout drying, farmers use traditional methods (squeezing cherries for flexibility, biting to assess texture) to target a moisture content of 10\u201312%. This level is critical for long-term storage: over-drying leads to brittle beans, while under-drying risks mold growth.\n\n6. *Traditional Storage in Jute Sacks or Clay Pots*  \nDried cherries are stored in breathable jute sacks (for large batches) or sealed clay pots (qadah, for small lots). Jute allows slight air circulation to prevent moisture buildup, while clay pots protect beans from pests and environmental fluctuations, often stored in cool, dark rooms or underground cellars.\n\n7. *Optional Partial Depulping*  \nWhile full natural processing (leaving skin and pulp intact) is standard, some farmers practice partial depulping using hand-held tools. This removes only the outer skin but leaves the sticky mucilage layer, resulting in a cleaner flavor profile while retaining natural fruity notes.\n\n8. *Limited-Water Washing (Rare, High-Quality Lots)*  \nWashed processing is extremely rare in Yemen due to water scarcity, but a small number of premium lots undergo minimal washing. Farmers use small amounts of well or spring water to remove mucilage after depulping, then dry beans immediately. This method produces a brighter, more acidic coffee compared to natural-processed variants.\n\n9. *Rooftop Drying (Urban/Flatland Alternative)*  \nIn urban areas or flat regions where raised mats are impractical, farmers dry cherries on concrete rooftops. While convenient, this carries higher contamination risks from dust and pollutants, so cherries are spread in thin layers and turned frequently to ensure even drying.\n\n10. *Secondary Sorting Post-Drying*  \nBefore hulling, dried cherries undergo a second manual sort to remove under-dried, over-dried, or moldy specimens. Farmers pick through batches to ensure only high-quality cherries proceed, preserving the batch\u2019s consistent flavor profile.\n\n11. *Hulling with Traditional Stone Mills*  \nHulling (removing the dried outer cherry shell) uses stone mills\u2014operated manually, by animals (e.g., donkeys), or small motors in modernized areas. These mills crack the shell without damaging green beans, preserving their structural integrity and flavor.\n\n12. *Natural Winnowing to Separate Chaff*  \nAfter hulling, farmers use wind-powered winnowing: tossing beans and chaff into the air, allowing wind to blow away light chaff while heavier beans fall back into a container. This eco-friendly method requires no specialized equipment.\n\n13. *Hand-Sorting by Size and Color*  \nBeans are spread on mats and sorted manually to remove small, discolored, or damaged specimens, leaving only uniform, plump beans. This step ensures even roasting and brewing, as beans of similar size extract consistently.\n\n14. *Small-Batch Roasting in Metal Pans*  \nTraditional roasting is done on-demand at home or local caf\u00e9s using metal pans (tawa) over wood or charcoal fires. Roasters stir beans constantly with wooden spoons to prevent burning, targeting a medium-dark roast that highlights rich, fruity flavors.\n\n15. *Grinding with Mortar and Pestle (Raha)*  \nRoasted beans are ground to a very fine consistency using a mortar and pestle (raha) or small manual grinder. This fine grind is ideal for brewing in a jebena, ensuring optimal flavor extraction during the slow brewing process.\n\n16. *Brewing in a Jebena (Clay Coffee Pot)*  \nIntegral to Yemeni culture, brewing in a jebena (a bulbous clay pot with a long spout) is tied to traditional processing. The pot is heated over an open fire, and finely ground coffee (often spiced with cardamom) is brewed slowly. The resulting coffee is served in small cups (finjal) during social gatherings.\n\n17. *Qishr Production (By-Product Utilization)*  \nA key traditional by-product is qishr, a sweet, fruity drink made from dried cherry skins and pulp left after hulling. Farmers collect these by-products, dry them further, and grind them to make a tea-like beverage\u2014popular during Ramadan and a sustainable way to reduce processing waste."}

Task Summary\nThis project focuses on developing a lightweight, edge-deployable few-shot semantic segmentation model that can adapt to new object classes with 1\u20135 labeled examples while maintaining high performance on real-world noisy inputs. The core approach integrates three key components: a dual-branch feature fusion module to enhance low-level spatial details and high-level semantic information, knowledge distillation from a large pre-trained ViT-based model to preserve accuracy in a compact architecture, and quantization-aware training to optimize for edge device constraints. We will evaluate the model on standard benchmarks (Pascal VOC, COCO) and a custom edge-specific dataset with low-light, motion-blur, and compression noise. The primary objectives are to achieve 85%+ mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on 5-shot Pascal VOC, keep the model size under 10MB, and reduce inference time to under 50ms on a mid-tier smartphone (Samsung Galaxy A52), enabling on-device adaptation without cloud dependency.\n***\nPart 2. Motivation\nCurrent state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models rely on massive labeled datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to collect for niche edge use cases like industrial inspection, smart home monitoring, or agricultural field analysis. Existing few-shot segmentation models, while reducing data requirements, are often too large and computationally intensive to run on edge devices, forcing reliance on cloud processing that introduces latency and privacy risks. Additionally, real-world edge environments frequently produce noisy inputs that degrade model performance, a gap unaddressed by most academic benchmarks. This project addresses these critical limitations by bridging high-performance few-shot segmentation with edge deployability, enabling low-latency, privacy-preserving on-device adaptation for scenarios where labeled data is scarce and cloud access is impractical.\n***\nPart 3. Milestone objectives\nMilestone 1 (Weeks 1\u20134): Baseline Setup and Data Preparation. Establish a baseline using a MobileNetV2 backbone with a lightweight segmentation head, validate its performance on 5-shot Pascal VOC (target: 70% mIoU, model size <15MB), and collect/annotate a custom edge dataset of 10k images across 10 classes with real-world noise augmentations. Milestone 2 (Weeks 5\u201312): Model Development and Optimization. Design and implement the dual-branch feature fusion module, integrate knowledge distillation from a pre-trained ViT-L/16 model to boost accuracy, and apply quantization-aware training to reduce model size and latency. Targets for this phase include 82% mIoU on 5-shot Pascal VOC, model size <12MB, and inference time <70ms on the target smartphone. Milestone 3 (Weeks 13\u201316): Validation and Deployment. Validate the model on COCO and the custom noisy dataset, optimize for TensorFlow Lite deployment, conduct real-world field tests (smart home monitoring, industrial part inspection), and prepare a draft paper for submission to the CVPR EdgeCV workshop. Final targets are 85%+ mIoU on 5-shot Pascal VOC, <10MB model size, <50ms inference time, and 80%+ mIoU on the custom edge dataset.\n***\nPart 4. Timeline\nWeeks 1\u20132: Complete a comprehensive literature review of lightweight few-shot segmentation and edge optimization techniques; set up the codebase using PyTorch and TensorFlow Lite, and preprocess the Pascal VOC and COCO datasets with few-shot sampling logic.

Weeks 13\u201314: Validate the optimized model on COCO and the custom noisy dataset, refine data augmentation strategies to handle edge-specific noise, and fix edge-case performance issues (e.g., small object segmentation). Weeks 15\u201316: Deploy the model to the target smartphone, conduct 2 weeks of real-world field tests, compile final performance reports, and draft the workshop paper with key findings and ablation studies.\n***\nPart 5.

Unlike direct translations, synonyms can carry cultural nuances, traditions, or positive connotations that align with local values. For example, a beverage brand might use a synonym for \"refreshment\" that evokes regional summer traditions in Southeast Asia, while opting for another synonym that ties to cozy winter gatherings in Northern Europe. These synonyms are not just word replacements\u2014they are cultural bridges that signal the company understands and respects local customs, making the product feel less like an imported good and more like a familiar, trusted option.  \n\n2. **Mitigate Negative or Unintended Connotations**  \nA single product name can have unintended offensive, silly, or irrelevant meanings in different languages or dialects. By leveraging region-appropriate synonyms, companies can avoid brand damage caused by such linguistic missteps. For instance, a car model that translates to \"broken\" in a certain African language can be rebranded with a synonym that conveys strength or reliability in that market. Proactively researching and adopting these synonyms ensures the product name remains positive and aligned with local linguistic norms, preventing costly rebranding efforts later.  \n\n3. **Boost Local SEO and Discoverability**  \nLocal consumers often search for products using terms specific to their regional dialect or slang\u2014terms that are effectively synonyms for the product\u2019s global name. By optimizing the product\u2019s local name with these high-intent synonyms, a company can improve its visibility in local search engine results. For example, a fitness brand might use a regional synonym for \"workout gear\" in Latin America that\u2019s more commonly used in local fitness communities than the global term. Integrating these synonyms into website content, social media posts, and local ad copy also enhances targeting, ensuring the product reaches consumers who are actively searching for it using their native terminology.  \n\n4. **Strengthen Brand Localization Beyond Basic Translation**  \nDirect translations can feel stiff or disconnected from local discourse, but region-specific synonyms capture the nuanced language used in everyday life. For a skincare brand, using a synonym for \"hydration\" that\u2019s a staple in local beauty blogs and conversations in South Korea will resonate far more than a literal translation. These synonyms show that the company has invested in understanding local consumer behavior and linguistic preferences, positioning the brand as attentive and customer-centric rather than one-size-fits-all.  \n\n5. **Cater to Linguistic Diversity Within Regions**  \nMany countries are home to multiple linguistic groups, each with their own preferred terms for products. By adopting tailored synonyms for each group, a company can ensure inclusivity and reach a broader audience. For example, in India, a snack brand might use synonyms for \"crunchy\" in Hindi, Tamil, and Bengali to target consumers across different linguistic states. Each synonym validates the group\u2019s linguistic identity, fostering a sense of belonging and encouraging brand loyalty among diverse communities."}
{"prompt": "Describe the manufacturing process of aluminium cans and the specific techniques used to ensure food safety and preservation.\n\nYour response must include the keywords waste, material and meal. Your response should have more than 30 sentences.", "response": "Aluminum cans are one of the most widely used packaging solutions for ready-to-eat meals, beverages, and processed foods, thanks to their durability, lightweight nature, and exceptional ability to preserve food safety. The manufacturing process of these cans is a highly optimized, multi-stage operation that combines advanced engineering with strict quality control to ensure both efficiency and compliance with food safety standards. \n\nThe journey begins with sourcing the primary material: aluminum. While aluminum is the most abundant metal in the Earth\u2019s crust, it is rarely found in its pure form, so manufacturers start with bauxite ore, a reddish-brown rock rich in aluminum oxide. The bauxite is mined from open-pit mines, then transported to refineries where it undergoes the Bayer process\u2014an industrial method that extracts alumina (aluminum oxide) from the ore by dissolving it in hot, concentrated sodium hydroxide, filtering out impurities, and precipitating pure alumina crystals. These crystals are then heated to over 2000\u00b0C in a rotary kiln to produce anhydrous alumina, which is the key feedstock for aluminum production. \n\nNext, the anhydrous alumina is converted into pure aluminum metal through the Hall-H\u00e9roult process. This involves melting the alumina in a molten cryolite bath at around 960\u00b0C, then passing a strong electric current through the mixture. The electrolytic reaction separates aluminum from oxygen, producing liquid aluminum that is siphoned off and cast into large ingots or slabs. A significant portion of the aluminum used in can manufacturing comes from recycled material, which not only reduces the environmental impact but also minimizes waste generated from discarded cans. In fact, aluminum is 100% recyclable without losing its quality, and recycling a single aluminum can saves enough energy to power a television for three hours, making it a cornerstone of sustainable packaging practices. \n\nOnce the aluminum ingots are ready, they are sent to rolling mills to be transformed into thin, uniform coils. The ingots are first heated to a malleable temperature, then passed through a series of rolling stands that gradually reduce their thickness. For can bodies, the aluminum is rolled into coils that are just 0.2 to 0.3 millimeters thick\u2014thin enough to be lightweight but strong enough to withstand the pressure of sealed contents and handling during transportation. For can lids, the coils are slightly thicker to accommodate the tab mechanism, ensuring the lid remains intact until it is opened by the consumer. \n\nThe next stage in can body production is cupping. Large aluminum coils are fed into a cupping press, which uses a punch and die to cut circular blanks from the coil and draw them into shallow cups. Each cupping press can produce thousands of cups per minute, making this one of the fastest stages of the manufacturing process. After cupping, the cups are transferred to a bodymaker machine, where they undergo a process called drawing and ironing. During this step, the cups are pulled through a series of dies that stretch the aluminum vertically, reducing the wall thickness while increasing the height of the can body. This creates the tall, cylindrical shape that we recognize as a standard aluminum can. \n\nOnce the can bodies have reached their desired height and shape, they are trimmed to ensure a uniform top edge, which is essential for creating a tight hermetic seal with the lid later on. Trimming also removes any uneven or jagged edges that could compromise the can\u2019s structural integrity or food safety. After trimming, the can bodies are washed thoroughly with a high-pressure, sanitized solution to remove any metal shavings, dust, or residual lubricants used during the drawing and ironing process. This washing step is critical for maintaining hygiene, as any contaminants left on the can could contaminate the meal or beverage that is later sealed inside. \n\nFollowing washing, the can bodies are dried in a heated oven to remove all moisture, which prepares them for coating. The internal coating is one of the most important components for ensuring food safety, as it acts as a barrier between the aluminum material and the contents of the can. Most internal coatings are epoxy-based, designed to prevent the acidic or alkaline components of certain meals (like tomato-based sauces or acidic fruits) from reacting with the aluminum. This reaction could otherwise lead to the leaching of aluminum into the food, which not only affects the taste of the meal but also poses potential health risks. The external coating, on the other hand, is applied to provide a smooth surface for printing labels and to protect the can from scratches and corrosion during storage and transportation. \n\nAfter coating, the can bodies are decorated with printing using high-speed rotary presses. These presses apply vibrant, food-safe inks that display product information, branding, and nutritional details for the canned meal. The printing process is closely monitored to ensure that the inks do not contain any harmful chemicals that could migrate into the food. Once printed, the can bodies undergo necking and flanging: the top edge of the can is narrowed (necked) to fit the lid, and a flange is created by folding the edge outward to provide a surface for sealing the lid in place. \n\nThe manufacturing of can lids follows a similar but distinct process, starting from the same aluminum material coils used for can bodies. First, the coils are fed into a blanking press, which cuts circular blanks of the appropriate size for the lids. These blanks are then transferred to a lid-forming machine, which uses a series of dies to shape the blank into a concave lid with a raised rim that will fit perfectly onto the can body\u2019s flange. Next, the lid is scored with a thin, precise line that allows the pull tab to be easily lifted, and a small rivet is attached to secure the tab to the lid. The tab is a critical component, as it must remain attached to the lid after opening to prevent it from becoming a choking hazard or a piece of waste that could end up in the environment. \n\nLike the can bodies, the lids are coated on their internal surface with the same epoxy-based material to prevent aluminum leaching and ensure food safety. The coating is cured in a high-temperature oven to ensure it adheres firmly to the aluminum and forms an impermeable barrier. Before being sent to canning facilities, both the can bodies and lids undergo rigorous quality control checks to ensure they meet strict safety standards. These checks include measuring the thickness of the aluminum material, inspecting the coating for any defects or gaps, and testing the structural integrity of the can bodies and lids to ensure they can withstand the pressure of retort processing, which is commonly used to sterilize canned meals. \n\nNow, turning to the specific techniques used to ensure food safety and preservation for canned meals. One of the most important steps is the hermetic sealing of the can, which creates an airtight barrier that prevents bacteria, mold, and other pathogens from entering the can and contaminating the meal. This seal is created using a seaming machine, which crimps the lid\u2019s rim onto the can body\u2019s flange in two separate operations: the first seam (primary seam) and the second seam (secondary seam). Each seam is carefully inspected to ensure it is tight and uniform, as even a tiny gap could lead to spoilage of the meal inside. \n\nAnother key technique for food safety is retort processing, which is used for most canned meals. After the can is filled with the prepared meal and sealed, it is placed in a retort\u2014a large, pressurized chamber where it is heated to a high temperature (typically between 115\u00b0C and 121\u00b0C) for a specific period of time. This heat treatment kills any harmful microorganisms, including spores of bacteria like Clostridium botulinum, which can cause severe food poisoning if left untreated. Unlike regular boiling, retort processing uses pressure to raise the boiling point of water, ensuring that even heat-resistant spores are destroyed. The combination of the hermetic seal and retort processing ensures that the canned meal remains safe to eat for months or even years without the need for refrigeration. \n\nTo further enhance food safety, manufacturers pay close attention to the purity of the aluminum material used in can production. All aluminum ingots and recycled aluminum waste must meet strict purity standards, with minimal levels of impurities like lead, cadmium, or mercury, which could be harmful if they leach into the food. Additionally, the coating materials used on the inside of the cans are tested extensively to ensure they are non-toxic and do not react with the contents of the can. These coatings are approved by food safety regulatory bodies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to ensure they are safe for contact with food and meals. \n\nMinimizing waste is not only an environmental priority but also contributes to food safety. Aluminum manufacturers operate closed-loop recycling systems where any scrap material generated during production\u2014such as leftover aluminum coils, trimmed edges, or defective cans\u2014is collected, melted down, and reused in the manufacturing process. This reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and ensures that the aluminum material used in cans is as pure as possible, as recycled aluminum is often free from the impurities that can be present in newly mined ore. Additionally, many manufacturers have implemented lean manufacturing practices to minimize waste at every stage of production, such as optimizing the size of aluminum blanks to reduce scrap and using water-based lubricants that are easier to recycle and less harmful to the environment. \n\nHygiene in the production facility is another critical aspect of ensuring food safety for canned meals. All areas where cans are manufactured, filled, and sealed are maintained in strict compliance with good manufacturing practices (GMPs). This includes regular sanitization of equipment, floors, and surfaces using food-grade disinfectants, as well as requiring workers to wear protective clothing, gloves, and hairnets to prevent contamination. Many production lines are located in clean rooms with controlled air quality, which reduces the risk of airborne contaminants coming into contact with the"}
{"prompt": "Explain the differences between Kotlin and Java for developing Android applications, including the advantages and disadvantages of each language, focusing on the aspects that are particularly relevant for mobile app development.\n\nYour answer must have a title contained in double angular brackets, such as <<kotlin vs java>>.", "response": "<<Kotlin vs Java: A Comparative Analysis for Android App Development>>\n\nGoogle officially supports both Kotlin and Java for Android app development, with Kotlin named the preferred language in 2019. While both share JVM compatibility and seamless interoperability, they differ significantly in syntax, safety features, performance optimizations, and alignment with modern Android practices. Below is a detailed comparison focusing on aspects critical to mobile development, including advantages and disadvantages of each language:\n\n### 1. Syntax & Boilerplate Reduction (Mobile Dev Efficiency)\n#### Kotlin\n- **Advantages**: Extremely concise, eliminating repetitive boilerplate common in Android (e.g., getters/setters, equals() methods, adapter code). Features like data classes (one line to generate a fully functional model class) and extension functions (add methods to existing classes like Context without inheritance) speed up development and reduce human error.\n- **Disadvantages**: Developers accustomed to Java\u2019s explicit syntax may initially struggle with Kotlin\u2019s syntactic sugar (e.g., lambda expressions, smart casts).\n\n#### Java\n- **Advantages**: Verbose but straightforward OOP syntax that\u2019s familiar to millions of developers. Ideal for beginners new to object-oriented programming, as it emphasizes explicit code structure.\n- **Disadvantages**: Requires writing extensive boilerplate for basic tasks (e.g., 10+ lines for a model class vs. 1 in Kotlin), slowing down development and increasing the risk of bugs from repetitive code.\n\n### 2. Null Safety (Critical for App Robustness)\n#### Kotlin\n- **Advantages**: Built-in null safety system that enforces explicit nullable types (marked with `?`). This drastically reduces NullPointerExceptions (NPEs)\u2014a top cause of Android app crashes. The compiler enforces null checks, so developers can\u2019t accidentally access a nullable value without handling it.\n- **Disadvantages**: Initial confusion around nullable vs. non-nullable types and safe call operators (`?.`) for those new to the language.\n\n#### Java\n- **Advantages**: No extra syntax for null handling, which simplifies basic code writing.\n- **Disadvantages**: Highly error-prone; null checks are manual and easy to forget, leading to frequent NPEs that require time-consuming debugging. This is a major pain point in mobile development, where app stability directly impacts user retention.\n\n### 3. Async Task Management (Core for Mobile UX)\n#### Kotlin\n- **Advantages**: Uses coroutines\u2014lightweight, efficient async operations that use ~1KB of stack space (vs. 1MB for Java threads). Suspend functions let developers write async code that reads like synchronous code, eliminating callback hell (common in Android network/database tasks). Coroutines are optimized for mobile devices with limited memory, reducing the risk of ANRs (Application Not Responding) errors.\n- **Disadvantages**: Requires learning coroutine scopes, context switching, and structured concurrency rules.\n\n#### Java\n- **Advantages**: Relies on mature concurrency tools like threads, Executors, and CompletableFuture, which are familiar to most Java developers.\n- **Disadvantages**: Heavier concurrency models consume more memory, leading to higher resource usage on low-end devices. Complex async flows (e.g., network calls followed by database updates) result in verbose, hard-to-maintain code.\n\n### 4. Interoperability & Migration\n#### Kotlin\n- **Advantages**: Full seamless interoperability with Java\u2014can call Java libraries, legacy code, and frameworks without modification. Supports incremental migration, so teams can adopt Kotlin gradually without rewriting entire codebases.\n- **Disadvantages**: Some Kotlin-specific features (e.g., coroutines, data classes) are not directly accessible from Java, requiring wrapper code for cross-language use.\n\n#### Java\n- **Advantages**: Can call Kotlin code via generated JVM bytecode, enabling teams to retain legacy Java modules while integrating new Kotlin features.\n- **Disadvantages**: Cannot leverage Kotlin\u2019s modern features natively, limiting access to optimized Android Jetpack APIs.\n\n### 5. Performance & Resource Efficiency\n#### Kotlin\n- **Advantages**: Compiles to JVM bytecode with performance nearly identical to Java. Coroutines and inline functions offer minor but impactful performance gains for mobile use cases (e.g., faster async task execution, lower memory overhead).\n- **Disadvantages**: Rare edge cases where syntactic sugar adds minimal overhead, though this is easily mitigated by compiler optimizations.\n\n#### Java\n- **Advantages**: Mature JVM optimizations and extensive profiling tools for performance tuning.\n- **Disadvantages**: Heavier concurrency models lead to higher memory usage on resource-constrained mobile devices, potentially impacting app responsiveness.\n\n### 6. Tooling & Ecosystem Alignment\n#### Kotlin\n- **Advantages**: First-class support in Android Studio, with optimized integration for modern Android features like Jetpack Compose and Jetpack libraries (many Jetpack APIs have Kotlin-specific extensions). Google\u2019s official documentation and best practices now prioritize Kotlin.\n- **Disadvantages**: Smaller ecosystem of third-party plugins compared to Java, though this gap is closing rapidly.\n\n#### Java\n- **Advantages**: Mature tooling ecosystem with extensive third-party plugins, debugging tools, and testing frameworks.\n- **Disadvantages**: Less optimized for modern Android features (e.g., Compose code is significantly more verbose in Java than Kotlin). Google\u2019s future roadmap focuses on Kotlin, so Java will receive fewer updates for new Android capabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Kotlin**: The best choice for new Android projects, thanks to its modern features, reduced boilerplate, null safety, and alignment with Google\u2019s roadmap. It\u2019s ideal for building robust, efficient apps with better user experiences.\n- **Java**: Suitable for maintaining legacy Android apps or if the team has limited Kotlin experience. However, migrating to Kotlin is recommended for long-term maintainability and access to cutting-edge Android features.\n\nFor most mobile development teams, Kotlin offers clear advantages in productivity, app stability, and future-proofing, making it the preferred language for modern Android development."}

Wade federally\u2014and climate policy, where the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act clean energy incentives face pushback from fossil fuel industries and GOP lawmakers who claim they undermine energy independence and raise consumer costs.\n\nSimultaneously, the U.S. economic landscape remains fraught with persistent challenges: inflation has cooled from its 2022 peak but still hovers around 3.7%, well above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, leading to ongoing interest rate hikes that have made mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt prohibitively expensive for millions, while wage growth has failed to keep pace with rising costs of essentials like rent, groceries, and prescription drugs, pushing working-class and middle-class families deeper into financial precarity, compounded by the October 2023 resumption of federal student loan payments after a three-year pandemic pause, which is expected to slash consumer spending (a cornerstone of the U.S. economy) as borrowers grapple with monthly payments averaging $200 to $300, and partisan fights continue over whether to extend relief measures or pursue broader debt cancellation that progressives demand but Republicans decry as unfair to taxpayers who avoided student loans.\n\nFinally, the ongoing southern border crisis remains a flashpoint of division, with record migrant crossings in 2023\u2014driven by violence, poverty, and political collapse in Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Haiti\u2014straining border patrol resources, overcrowding detention facilities, and sparking humanitarian crises as migrants wait for asylum processing, while the Biden administration\u2019s new restrictions (requiring migrants to apply for asylum online or via third countries) clash with Republican-led states like Texas, which has deployed National Guard troops and razor wire barriers, igniting legal battles over federal vs. state authority, and comprehensive immigration reform remains stuck in congressional gridlock, leaving millions of undocumented immigrants in limbo and key sectors like agriculture, construction, and healthcare struggling to fill critical labor gaps that hinder economic growth."}

{"prompt": "Describe the challenges faced by people with disabilities in accessing education.\n\nYour article must end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "# Unseen Barriers: The Challenges of Accessing Education for People with Disabilities\n\nEducation is universally recognized as a fundamental human right, yet for millions of people with disabilities worldwide, this right remains a distant goal. From physical obstacles to systemic neglect and deep-seated stigma, the barriers they face are multifaceted, intersecting to create a cycle of exclusion that limits their academic and personal growth.\n\nOne of the most immediate hurdles is physical inaccessibility. Many schools, particularly in low-resource regions, lack basic accommodations for students with mobility impairments: no ramps leading to classrooms, narrow doorways that can\u2019t fit wheelchairs, broken elevators in multi-story buildings, or restrooms designed without accessibility in mind. For visually impaired students, the absence of braille textbooks, audio learning materials, or screen-reading software turns simple assignments into insurmountable tasks. Deaf or hard-of-hearing learners often sit through lectures without sign language interpreters or closed captions, missing critical information their peers absorb effortlessly. Even in wealthier nations, rural schools frequently lack the resources to adapt spaces or materials, leaving students with disabilities isolated from mainstream learning.\n\nBeyond physical barriers, neurodivergent and intellectually disabled students face a one-size-fits-all curriculum that fails to meet their unique needs. Students with dyslexia may struggle with traditional reading tasks without access to phonics-based tools or text-to-speech software. Those with ADHD or autism often find noisy, overstimulating classrooms unbearable, yet few schools offer quiet sensory-friendly spaces or flexible learning schedules. Many teachers, with minimal training in inclusive education, misinterpret these challenges as behavioral issues rather than learning differences, leading to unfair discipline or inadequate support. For students with intellectual disabilities, segregation into underfunded special schools\u2014instead of inclusive classrooms\u2014denies them the chance to learn alongside peers and access high-quality education.\n\nStigma and social exclusion compound these struggles. Students with disabilities are frequent targets of bullying, teasing, or isolation, eroding their self-esteem and mental health. Educators and parents may hold biased views, underestimating their abilities and setting low academic expectations. This stigma can prevent students from seeking necessary accommodations, as they fear being labeled \u201cdifferent\u201d or \u201cless capable.\u201d In some communities, disability is surrounded by misconceptions, leading families to keep children with disabilities out of school entirely to avoid shame.\n\nSystemic failures further entrench these disparities. While many countries have laws mandating inclusive education, enforcement is weak, and funding for special education programs is woefully insufficient. There is a global shortage of trained professionals: special education teachers, sign language interpreters, occupational therapists, and counselors who can support diverse needs. Higher education institutions are even less accessible, with few accommodations for students with disabilities, making it hard for them to pursue tertiary studies and advance their careers.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires collective action: enforcing inclusive education laws, investing in accessible infrastructure and assistive technology, training educators to meet diverse needs, and challenging societal stigma. Only then can we ensure every student, regardless of disability, has the chance to learn, grow, and reach their full potential.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}

That changed when a rainy morning forced me to put my headphones down (dead battery, of all things). Suddenly, the bus I\u2019d ridden a hundred times became a stage for small, extraordinary moments. Here are the sights that turned my tedious commutes into something I now look forward to.\n\n## The Origami Crane Exchange\nIt was a gray, drizzly Tuesday, and the bus was packed with bleary-eyed commuters. I was staring out the window at the rain-slicked streets when a soft giggle caught my ear. In the seat across from me, an elderly man with white hair and a tweed jacket was teaching a fidgety 7-year-old how to fold origami cranes. The kid\u2019s small fingers fumbled with the paper, and the man leaned in, his voice gentle as he walked her through each step: \u201cFold the top corner down to the bottom\u2026 just like that, you\u2019ve got it.\u201d\n\nBy the time we reached the hospital stop, the kid had made three lopsided cranes. She handed one to the man, who tucked it into his pocket with a grin. Then she turned to a harried-looking nurse sitting next to her, who\u2019d been typing furiously on her laptop, and held out another. \u201cFor you,\u201d she said. The nurse paused, her face softening as she took the crane. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and for the first time that morning, I saw her smile.\n\n## The Midnight Cello Concert\nI was coming home from a late shift, dragging my feet through an almost-empty subway station. The only sounds were the hum of the overhead lights and my own tired footsteps\u2014until I heard it: the rich, warm notes of a cello floating through the tunnel.\n\nAt the far end of the platform, a woman in a black coat was playing *Clair de Lune*. Her eyes were closed, her bow moving smoothly over the strings. A handful of other late-night commuters had stopped to listen: a delivery driver leaning against a pillar, a student flipping through a textbook but pausing to tap their foot, a couple holding hands. No one spoke. When she finished, the station erupted in quiet applause. A man dropped a $20 bill into her case; she nodded, then launched into a lively folk tune that made the student laugh. For 10 minutes, the stress of the day melted away. We weren\u2019t just tired strangers\u2014we were a small audience, united by a single, beautiful sound.\n\n## The Autumn Sketchbook\nLast fall, I took a regional train to visit my parents. The windows were fogged with the crisp, cool air, and the countryside outside was ablaze with red and orange maple trees. Next to me, a woman in a flannel shirt was sketching furiously in a leather-bound notebook. Her pencil moved quickly, capturing the rolling hills, a herd of cows grazing in a field, and a small barn with a weathered roof.\n\nA tourist from Japan, sitting across the aisle, leaned over and pointed to her sketchbook. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said, her English a little shaky. The woman smiled and held out the book. The tourist flipped through the pages, gasping at the detailed drawings of city streets, mountain lakes, and even a few portraits of strangers she\u2019d met on trains. When we reached the tourist\u2019s stop, the woman tore out a small sketch of the autumn trees and handed it to her. \u201cFor your trip,\u201d she said. The tourist bowed, tears in her eyes, and promised to hang it on her wall when she got home.\n\n## The Magic of the Ordinary\nThese moments aren\u2019t grand or flashy. They\u2019re the kind of sights you miss if you\u2019re too busy scrolling or listening to a podcast. But they\u2019re the heart of public transit: strangers connecting over origami, music, or a shared love of autumn. Now, I leave my headphones in my bag at least once a week. I watch the world go by, and I wait\u2014for the next small, fascinating sight that reminds me that the journey is just as important as the destination.\n\nSo next time you\u2019re on a bus, train, or subway, put down your phone for a minute. Look around. You might just witness something that makes your whole day brighter."}

She then graduated to a late-night matcha food truck in a college town, where she mastered the art of saying \"yes\" to even the most unhinged requests\u2014think matcha lattes with a dash of wasabi or honey drizzle made from local dandelions. Her quick adaptability and love of weird customer quirks make her a natural fit for any coffee shop, but her hard-earned credentials really seal the deal:\n* Mastered the art of taming finicky espresso machines after spending three weekends troubleshooting a 1980s La Marzocco named Gary, who initially sounded like a disgruntled lawnmower but now purrs like a contented kitten (she even made him a tiny knit cozy for his portafilter)\n* Developed a photographic memory for absurdly specific regular orders\u2014including the retiree who wants his decaf latte \"so hot it could melt a snowman\u2019s soul\" and the barista intern who once asked for a cold brew with extra espresso (she didn\u2019t judge, just made it and called it a \"wake-up slushie\")\n\nSECTION 2: Turning New Skills Into Coffee Magic (No Spellbook Required)\nAntonia\u2019s real superpower isn\u2019t just her ability to pull a perfect shot\u2014it\u2019s how fast she learns new tricks and makes them her own. When the food truck decided to add cold brew on tap, she taught herself the ins and outs of batch brewing by binging YouTube tutorials at 2 a.m. (and drinking the less-than-perfect batches, which is how she discovered her caffeine tolerance is higher than a giraffe\u2019s neck). She\u2019s also a pro at rolling with unexpected chaos: once, during a sudden rainstorm at the food truck, she turned the wait time into a mini coffee trivia game, handing out free cookie samples to anyone who could name three types of coffee beans. For a coffee company that values personality as much as precision, Antonia\u2019s ability to adapt, learn, and keep customers laughing is worth its weight in freshly roasted beans. She doesn\u2019t just learn new skills\u2014she wraps them in a layer of silly charm that makes every order feel like a small adventure."}

The associations here were sharper, edged with the bite of winter wind. She remembered the blizzard of \u201998, waiting at the bus stop until her toes went numb, her backpack heavy with textbooks. Then her mother\u2019s car skidded into view, the scarf already in her hand. They\u2019d wrapped it around both their necks in the front seat, sharing a thermos of hot cocoa that steamed against the fogged windows. Clara realized that some associations are warm, others are a quiet ache, but all of them are threads that tie her to the woman she\u2019d lost six months prior.\n\nA tattered copy of *Where the Wild Things Are* fell from the next box, its pages stuck together with old grape juice stains. The associations here were softer, laced with the hush of bedtime. Her mother had read it to her every night after her sister was born, when Clara felt small and forgotten, like the last cookie on the plate. Mom would do Max\u2019s voice in a deep growl that made Clara giggle, even when her eyes were heavy with tears. These associations were a reminder that love doesn\u2019t always shout\u2014it sometimes whispers through storybook pages and sticky juice stains, wrapping around you when you least expect it.\n\nShe stood up, brushing dust from her jeans, and looked out the attic window at the gnarled apple tree in the backyard. The associations of climbing it at seven, scraping her knee on a branch, and her mother rushing over with a band-aid shaped like a butterfly flooded in. Later that day, they\u2019d made apple pie from the fruit she\u2019d picked, the smell filling the house until even the cat curled up on the counter, purring. Clara thought about how every object in this attic held a constellation of associations, each one a star that lit up a corner of her past she\u2019d almost forgotten.\n\nAs she carried the teacup, scarf, and book downstairs, she realized that these associations weren\u2019t just trapped in things. They were alive in her\u2014every time she smelled chamomile, every time she wrapped a scarf around her neck on a cold day, every time she read a story to her own daughter. She set the teacup on the kitchen table, filled it with hot chamomile, and wrapped the scarf around her shoulders. For a moment, she could almost hear her mother\u2019s laugh, soft and warm, coming from the next room. The associations didn\u2019t just make her sad; they made her feel connected, like her mother was still there, in the cracks of the cup, the fray of the scarf, and the words of a storybook that had been read a thousand times."}

{"prompt": "Mention the common challenges when learning to ride a bike without mentioning falling or scraping knees.\n\nYour response must not include the words 'can' and 'ride'.", "response": "Common challenges include:\n- Sustaining steady forward momentum while keeping the body aligned over the frame; even minor shifts in weight or fluctuations in speed disrupt equilibrium, requiring constant, subtle adjustments to stay centered.\n- Coordinating the rhythmic circular motion of feet on pedals with delicate hand movements on the handlebars to maintain a straight path. Misalignment between these actions often leads to veering off course unexpectedly, forcing quick, unrefined corrections.\n- Mastering the timing and pressure of brake application to slow gradually instead of jolting the body forward. Abrupt, overzealous braking disrupts the body\u2019s center of gravity, making it hard to stay balanced.\n- Overcoming the instinct to tense up the upper body when feeling unsteady. Rigid shoulders and arms reduce the ability to make smooth steering adjustments, creating a cycle of increased tension and instability.\n- Judging spatial distance to navigate small obstacles\u2014such as curbs, gravel patches, or low branches\u2014without overcorrecting steering. Miscalculations here can throw off balance or lead to unintended swerves.\n- Building confidence to let go of reliance on training wheels or a helper\u2019s support. The transition to independent movement often triggers mental hesitation, which translates to physical stiffness and reduced control."}

A breaking point came when he woke up in a hospital following a drunk-driving accident that injured a stranger\u2014an incident that left him facing legal consequences and a crushing sense of guilt.\n\nInstead of retreating into denial, he made the choice to take radical accountability. First, he reached out to a court-mandated rehab program, but quickly shifted from complying to actively engaging: he attended daily therapy sessions to unpack the trauma that had fueled his addiction, joined peer support groups, and committed to a sober lifestyle. \n\nNext, he focused on making amends. He wrote a heartfelt, unflinching apology to the stranger he\u2019d injured, offered to cover their medical expenses (working odd jobs to save the money), and completed 200 hours of community service at a local trauma recovery center. With his ex-wife\u2019s permission, he started showing up consistently to his kids\u2019 school events\u2014quietly, without expecting immediate forgiveness\u2014gradually rebuilding trust through small, reliable acts.\n\nAs he healed, he found redemption not in being \u201cforgiven\u201d by everyone, but in redefining his purpose. He trained to become a substance abuse counselor, using his own story to help others navigate their struggles. Over time, he reconnected with his children, who slowly began to see the steady, compassionate man he\u2019d become.\n\nFor him, redemption wasn\u2019t a single moment of absolution\u2014it was the daily choice to live with integrity, make amends for his past, and contribute to the well-being of others.

How does the cafe create an inclusive and affirming environment?\n\nYour file should have 4 sections, and each section should start with \"SECTION X\".", "response": "SECTION 1: LGBTQ+-Centered Programming and Community Hub Events\nThe Rainbow Cafe distinguishes itself as a dedicated community anchor by offering programming tailored to the diverse needs of the LGBTQ+ community, going far beyond typical cafe offerings. Core events include weekly trans and non-binary youth safe spaces, facilitated by local LGBTQ+ youth advocates, where participants can connect, share experiences, and access free resources like gender-affirming care guides. Monthly queer book clubs center works by intersectional LGBTQ+ authors (e.g., BIPOC, disabled, and trans creators), with discussions designed to amplify marginalized voices. Biweekly drag brunches feature local queer performers, with 20% of ticket sales donated to LGBTQ+ youth shelters. During Pride Month, the cafe hosts free workshops on gender-affirming makeup, queer history, and allyship, alongside a community art wall where patrons can share messages of solidarity. All events prioritize accessibility, with ASL interpreters available for public gatherings and sliding-scale ticket options for low-income attendees.\n\nSECTION 2: Inclusive Physical Space and Queer-Forward Branding\nThe cafe\u2019s physical environment and branding are intentionally designed to signal safety and affirmation for all LGBTQ+ individuals. Visible, gender-neutral restrooms are clearly marked with inclusive signage (avoiding binary symbols) and equipped with free menstrual products, gender-neutral changing stations, and hand soap labeled with gender-neutral language. The menu features items named after queer icons and pivotal historical moments\u2014such as the \u201cMarsha P. Johnson Muffin\u201d (a blueberry-lemon treat honoring the trans rights activist) and the \u201cStonewall Latte\u201d (a rainbow-hued layered drink). Thirty percent of ingredients are sourced from queer-owned bakeries and suppliers, amplifying marginalized business owners. Branding materials, from wall art to social media, center diverse representations of the community (including trans, non-binary, and BIPOC queer individuals) rather than relying solely on generic rainbow imagery, ensuring all patrons see themselves reflected.\n\nSECTION 3: Trauma-Informed Staff Training and Zero-Tolerance Policies\nTo foster an affirming environment, The Rainbow Cafe implements rigorous staff training and clear policies that prioritize LGBTQ+ safety. All employees complete mandatory trauma-informed training on gender identity, pronoun usage, and de-escalation techniques for handling incidents of homophobia, transphobia, or misgendering. Staff are required to wear pronoun badges, and managers conduct monthly check-ins to reinforce cultural competence. A prominent zero-tolerance policy for discrimination is posted throughout the cafe, with a confidential reporting system (including a dedicated email and in-person hotline) for patrons to flag issues. Additionally, the cafe designates a quiet, low-stimulation corner for neurodivergent LGBTQ+ patrons or those navigating social anxiety, ensuring the space is accessible to all community members.\n\nSECTION 4: Community-Led Governance and Mutual Aid Initiatives\nThe Rainbow Cafe\u2019s commitment to the LGBTQ+ community extends beyond daily operations through community-led decision-making and mutual aid. A 7-member advisory board, composed of LGBTQ+ community members (including trans youth advocates, BIPOC queer leaders, and disabled queer organizers), guides the cafe\u2019s programming, menu changes, and resource allocation. Each quarter, 15% of net profits are donated to local LGBTQ+ nonprofits, such as organizations providing free gender-affirming healthcare and housing for homeless queer youth. The cafe also offers free daily meal vouchers to at-risk LGBTQ+ youth in partnership with local shelters, and hosts monthly free clinics for name-change assistance and LGBTQ+ legal rights education. These initiatives ensure the cafe is not just a safe space but an active ally in advancing the well-being of the community it serves."}

{"prompt": "Compose a creative story which blends elements of mythology and mystery.\n\nYour response should include the keywords 'atlantis' and 'constable'.", "response": "**The Tidewarden\u2019s Oath**  \n\nThe fog clung to Trewyn\u2019s cliffs like a shroud when Constable Elara Voss found the adrift boat. Its sails were tattered, nets tangled in slimy kelp, and the only sign of its owner\u2014old Tom Pritchard\u2014was a chipped clay pipe and a stone amulet, warm to the touch, carved with a spiral that coiled into the shape of a trident.  \n\nElara had patrolled these shores for three years, seen every trick the sea played: rogue waves swallowing dinghies, fog swallowing landmarks, even the occasional ghost ship legend that made tourists lean in over pints at the Harbour Inn. But the amulet felt wrong. It hummed, a low thrumming that vibrated up her arm, as if it had a pulse of its own.  \n\nBy dawn, another boat was found. Same empty deck, same amulet left behind.  \n\nShe tracked down Mara, the town\u2019s oldest resident, who sat by her cottage fire spinning wool as thin as sea grass. When Elara laid the amulet on the table, Mara\u2019s hands stilled. Her eyes, milky with age, locked onto the symbol. \u201cThat\u2019s the mark of the Tidewardens,\u201d she said, her voice like pebbles grinding under waves. \u201cThe Sunken Citadel\u2019s guardians. They say it\u2019s a fragment of Atlantis, you know\u2014broke off when the great city fell, carried west by the tides.\u201d  \n\nElara scoffed. Atlantis was a fairy tale, a story told to sell postcards. But that night, she snuck into the local library\u2019s dust-choked restricted section and found a leather-bound journal, its pages warped by saltwater, written by a 19th-century explorer named Alistair Thorne. Thorne had mapped the coast and identified the Sunken Citadel as Atlantis\u2019s western outpost, guarded by the Tidewardens\u2014an order sworn to prevent the outpost from rising prematurely, lest its awakening unleash a tsunami that would drown every coastal town for a hundred miles.  \n\nThe spiral-trident symbol was their crest. And the journal spoke of a prophecy: when the constellation Cetus aligned with the North Star, the outpost would stir. Only a Tidewarden, bearing the amulet, could anchor it to the seabed, sacrificing a piece of their own life force to calm the tides.  \n\nThat explained the disappearances. Tom and the others weren\u2019t taken\u2014they were going to the Citadel, trying to fulfill the oath of their ancestors. But why hadn\u2019t they returned?  \n\nElara waited for low tide, then followed the shoreline to a hidden cave she\u2019d only heard rumors of. Its mouth was blocked by jagged rocks, but when she held the amulet aloft, the stones shifted as if pulled by an invisible hand, revealing a narrow passage. Inside, the cave opened into a vast chamber, its walls covered in murals that glowed faintly in the dark: Atlantis\u2019s golden spires piercing the clouds, the Tidewardens standing guard over a stormy sea, a great wave crashing over the outpost as the sky split with lightning.  \n\nAt the center of the chamber was a stone altar, and lying beside it was Tom, unconscious, his chest pressed against a pool of water that reflected the constellations above\u2014even though the cave was buried fifty feet below the cliffs. Elara rushed to him, but as she touched his shoulder, the pool flared. A voice echoed in her head, not with words, but with images: her grandmother, holding the same amulet, whispering \u201cTidewarden\u2019s blood runs in your veins.\u201d  \n\nElara\u2019s breath caught. Her grandmother had always told her stories of the sea, had given her a locket with the same spiral-trident symbol. She\u2019d dismissed it as a family heirloom, but now she knew the truth.  \n\nThe pool\u2019s glow intensified. Outside, the sea roared. Tom stirred, muttering, \u201cToo late\u2026 the anchor needs to be set.\u201d Elara looked at the amulet in her hand, then at the pool. She thought of the town, of the children playing on the beach, of the fishermen who relied on the sea for their livelihood.  \n\nShe placed the amulet on the altar, then stepped into the pool. The water was cold, but it didn\u2019t drown her\u2014it wrapped around her like a blanket, carrying the weight of a thousand years of oaths. She felt the power of Atlantis flowing through her: the crash of waves against golden walls, the laughter of Tidewardens in the Citadel\u2019s halls, the sorrow of watching their home sink beneath the sea.  \n\nThe murals lit up, and she saw the outpost rising beneath the waves, its spires glinting in the moonlight. But instead of a tsunami, the sea calmed. The fog lifted, and the stars shone bright, Cetus perfectly aligned with the North Star.  \n\nWhen she emerged from the pool, Tom was standing, awake. The amulet was gone, but she could feel its power in her bones\u2014a quiet hum, a reminder of her new role.  \n\nElara returned to Trewyn at dawn, her uniform soaked through, but the town was safe. The fishermen\u2019s boats returned to shore, and the sea was calm. She never told anyone what she\u2019d done, but every night, she patrolled the coast, her eyes fixed on the horizon.  \n\nShe was still Constable Voss, the town\u2019s protector. But she was also a Tidewarden, guarding the secret of Atlantis\u2019s outpost. And when the fog rolled in, she could almost hear the whispers of her ancestors, carried on the wind: *Well done, guardian*.  \n\nFor Atlantis was never truly gone. It was just waiting, beneath the waves, for the tide to call again."}
{"prompt": "Suggest some polite ways to ask out a person you admire.\n\nYour response must contain exactly 4 paragraphs. Separate each paragraph with two new lines. Put double quotation marks around your entire response. The very first paragraph must start with the word \"weekend\".", "response": "\"Weekend plans often feel incomplete when I\u2019m thinking about trying that new indie bookstore caf\u00e9 downtown\u2014would you be open to joining me there sometime soon? I\u2019ve heard they have amazing lavender lattes and a section of poetry collections I think you\u2019d love, since you mentioned enjoying Mary Oliver\u2019s work last week. I totally get if you\u2019re swamped or have other plans; no pressure at all, but I\u2019d really value getting to chat with you one-on-one outside of our usual group hangouts. Framing the ask around a shared interest and emphasizing that their comfort matters helps keep the tone warm and non-intrusive.\n\nIf you\u2019re someone who prefers low-pressure outings over more structured plans, a gentle way to ask could be framing it as a casual favor or shared activity. For example: \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to check out the new community garden\u2019s open house this Saturday, but I feel a little silly going alone. Would you happen to have time to come with me? I know you care about sustainable gardening, so I thought it might be right up your alley, and I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on their raised bed designs.\u201d This takes the focus off a \u201cdate\u201d label and centers the activity, which can ease any awkwardness they might feel and make it easier for them to say yes or no without overthinking.\n\nFor moments when you want to be clear but still leave room for them to decline gracefully, being upfront about your admiration can go a long way. You could say: \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed getting to know you over the past few months\u2014your perspective on art and your sense of humor always make my day brighter. I was wondering if you\u2019d be interested in going to that new art exhibit with me next Friday? No worries at all if you can\u2019t make it or aren\u2019t feeling it; I just wanted to put it out there.\u201d This acknowledges your feelings without putting them on the spot, and it shows you respect their autonomy to say no without hard feelings.\n\nFinally, adapting the ask to their known commitments can show you\u2019re paying attention and value their time. For instance: \u201cI know you\u2019ve been swamped with your work project lately, so I didn\u2019t want to add anything to your plate unnecessarily. But when you have a free evening in the next couple of weeks, would you want to grab dinner at that cozy Thai place you recommended? I\u2019ve been dying to try it, and I think it\u2019d be nice to catch up when you\u2019re not feeling rushed.\u201d This demonstrates empathy and thoughtfulness, which can make the person feel seen and more inclined to consider your offer, even if they need to reschedule to a later date.\""}

{"prompt": "Provide an analysis of the benefits and challenges of transitioning the US to 100% renewable energy by 2050, as described in the paragraph.\n\nIn your response, use words in all capital letters at least 3 times to highlight key points.", "response": "### Analysis of Transitioning the U.S. to 100% Renewable Energy by 2050: Benefits and Challenges\n\n#### Transformative Benefits\n1. **CLIMATE CRISIS MITIGATION**: The single most impactful advantage is eliminating nearly all power-sector greenhouse gas emissions, a critical step to slow global warming and avoid the worst effects of climate change. As one of the world\u2019s top emitters, the U.S. shifting to renewables would drastically reduce its carbon footprint, curb extreme weather events like catastrophic wildfires and hurricanes, and protect vulnerable communities from climate-related harm\u2014aligning with global goals to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n2. **ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND PRICE STABILITY**: Unlike fossil fuels, which depend on volatile global markets and foreign imports, renewables (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal) are abundant and domestic. Scaling up these sources would free the U.S. from geopolitical risks tied to oil and gas, insulate consumers from price spikes caused by international conflicts, and lock in long-term predictable energy costs as renewable technology becomes increasingly affordable.\n3. **MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND RURAL REVITALIZATION**: The renewable sector already employs more Americans than the fossil fuel industry, and a full transition would create millions of additional jobs in manufacturing, installation, maintenance, and research. Rural areas, in particular, would benefit from wind and solar farm development, bringing new income streams and revitalizing struggling communities that have been left behind by declining fossil fuel industries.\n\n#### Critical Challenges\n1. **INFRASTRUCTURE OVERHAUL AND ENERGY STORAGE GAPS**: The U.S. power grid was built for centralized fossil fuel plants, not distributed, intermittent renewables. A massive investment in high-voltage transmission lines is needed to move power from windy plains or sunny deserts to densely populated coastal cities. Even more pressing is addressing ENERGY STORAGE GAPS: current battery technology is too limited to store enough energy for extended periods of low wind or sun, risking gaps in power supply during peak demand or extreme weather.\n2. **Upfront Costs and Political Resistance**: Transitioning to 100% renewables requires trillions of dollars in upfront investment for grid upgrades, renewable installations, and storage systems. While long-term operational costs are far lower than fossil fuels, securing this funding amid political gridlock will be a major hurdle. Additionally, fossil fuel industries wield significant political influence, which could delay policy reforms, subsidies for renewables, and phase-outs of fossil fuel support.\n3. **Intermittency and Reliability Risks**: Even with improved storage, ensuring 24/7 reliable power remains a challenge. Prolonged periods of cloudy, calm weather could strain the grid, leading to BLACKOUTS AND ENERGY SHORTAGES if backup systems (like green hydrogen or geothermal) are not fully developed. The 2021 Texas winter storm highlighted how grid failures can have life-threatening consequences when systems are not designed to handle extreme conditions with renewable-heavy power sources.\n\n#### Conclusion\nWhile transitioning to 100% renewable energy by 2050 offers transformative benefits for the climate, economy, and national security, it requires overcoming significant infrastructure, financial, and technical barriers. Success will depend on bold policy action, massive investment in innovation, and a coordinated effort to address the needs of both urban and rural communities\u2014all while prioritizing equity to ensure no group is left behind in the shift away from fossil fuels."}

{"prompt": "Discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of implementing advanced navigation technologies on freeways to improve navigability.\n\nYour response must be in all lowercase letters, no capital letters allowed. Your response must be at least 900 words long.", "response": "advanced navigation technologies\u2014encompassing connected vehicle systems, ai-powered traffic management platforms, real-time dynamic routing tools, and vehicle-to-infrastructure (v2i) communication\u2014are increasingly being touted as a solution to the persistent challenges of freeway navigability, from crippling congestion to preventable crashes. while these technologies hold significant promise for transforming how we use freeways, they also come with a host of drawbacks that require careful consideration before widespread implementation.\n\none of the most compelling benefits of advanced navigation on freeways is its ability to reduce congestion and optimize traffic flow. traditional freeway management relies on static speed limits, fixed lane assignments, and reactive responses to incidents, which often fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions. advanced navigation systems, by contrast, leverage a network of sensors, cameras, and connected vehicles to collect and analyze data on traffic volume, speed, and incidents in real time. this data can be used to adjust dynamic speed limits\u2014slowing traffic slightly in busy sections to prevent stop-and-go waves, or increasing limits when lanes are clear. for example, in the netherlands, dynamic speed limits on the a12 freeway reduced congestion by 15% and cut travel times by an average of 10 minutes during peak hours. additionally, integrated navigation systems can manage on-ramp metering lights to sync with freeway traffic flow, ensuring that merges are smooth and do not disrupt the mainline. navigation apps like waze already use user-reported data to suggest alternate routes, but official freeway-integrated systems have access to more accurate, comprehensive data, including real-time information from road sensors and traffic control centers, making their routing recommendations more reliable and less likely to divert traffic onto overburdened local roads.\n\nenhanced safety is another critical advantage of advanced freeway navigation technologies. the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) estimates that vehicle-to-vehicle (v2v) communication alone could prevent up to 80% of non-impaired crashes by alerting drivers to hazards before they are visible. for instance, if a car ahead slams on brakes to avoid a stopped vehicle, all connected cars behind\u2014even those around a curve or blocked by other traffic\u2014receive an instant visual or auditory alert, giving drivers more time to react. v2i communication takes this a step further, allowing freeway infrastructure to send alerts about road work, closed lanes, or wrong-way drivers directly to connected vehicles. in some pilot programs, this technology has reduced rear-end crashes by 30% and lane-change crashes by 25%. advanced navigation can also integrate with driver assistance features, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist, to provide more targeted guidance: for example, guiding a driver to merge into a gap in traffic by displaying a visual cue on the dashboard, or warning about an upcoming sharp curve that requires a speed reduction.\n\nbeyond efficiency and safety, advanced navigation improves accessibility and user experience for a wide range of drivers. for elderly or disabled drivers, tailored navigation features\u2014like larger, high-contrast display text, voice commands with natural language processing, and alerts for accessible rest stops or parking near exits\u2014can make freeway travel less stressful and more manageable. commercial fleet operators also benefit significantly: optimized routing can account for vehicle weight limits, height restrictions, delivery windows, and fuel efficiency, reducing operational costs and improving on-time delivery rates. for example, a study of long-haul trucking companies found that advanced navigation systems reduced fuel consumption by 8-12% by avoiding idling in congestion and choosing routes with fewer elevation changes.\n\ndespite these benefits, implementing advanced navigation technologies on freeways presents several significant drawbacks. first and foremost are the high implementation and maintenance costs. installing the necessary infrastructure\u2014including sensors, communication towers, and traffic control software\u2014can cost millions of dollars per mile of freeway. for example, a 2022 report by the federal highway administration (fhwa) found that a fully integrated smart freeway system costs between $2 million and $5 million per mile, depending on the level of technology. smaller cities and rural regions with limited budgets may struggle to afford these costs, leading to a digital divide where only urban freeways get upgraded. additionally, maintenance costs are ongoing: sensors can be damaged by weather, accidents, or vandalism, and software requires regular updates to address security vulnerabilities and adapt to new traffic patterns. upgrading existing vehicles to support v2v and v2i communication is another major expense; most cars built before 2020 lack this technology, meaning full adoption could take decades, leaving older vehicles and their drivers at a disadvantage.\n\nprivacy and security concerns are another critical drawback. advanced navigation systems collect vast amounts of data, including driver locations, driving patterns, speed, and even vehicle diagnostics. this data is often shared with traffic control centers, navigation app providers, and sometimes third-party companies. while this data is essential for optimizing traffic flow, it poses significant privacy risks if not properly protected. there is a risk of data breaches, where hackers could access personal information or even take control of connected vehicles. in 2015, researchers demonstrated that they could remotely take control of a jeep cherokee through its infotainment system, highlighting the vulnerability of connected vehicles. additionally, governments or corporations could use this data for surveillance purposes, tracking drivers\u2019 movements and travel habits without explicit consent. for example, some cities have considered using navigation data to enforce tolls or congestion pricing, raising concerns about overreach and lack of transparency.\n\nover-reliance on technology and driver complacency is another potential pitfall. as drivers become more dependent on advanced navigation systems, they may lose their ability to navigate manually, which could be dangerous if the technology fails\u2014such as during a gps outage, sensor malfunction, or software glitch. there is also the risk of \u201cautomation bias,\u201d where drivers ignore their own judgment in favor of the system\u2019s recommendations, even when the system is wrong. for example, a driver might follow a navigation system\u2019s direction to turn onto a closed road, or fail to notice a hazard because they are relying on the system to alert them. studies have shown that drivers using advanced navigation systems often pay less attention to the road, with their eyes off the road for up to 20% more time than those using traditional maps. this increased inattention can lead to a higher risk of crashes, especially in unexpected situations.\n\nequity issues further complicate the implementation of advanced freeway navigation technologies. low-income drivers are more likely to drive older vehicles that lack integrated navigation or connected vehicle capabilities, so they will not benefit from the safety and efficiency features. this widens the gap between affluent drivers who can afford modern vehicles and low-income drivers who cannot. rural areas are also often left behind, as most investment in smart freeway systems goes to urban areas with higher traffic volumes. rural drivers, who may face longer travel distances and fewer services, miss out on the safety alerts and congestion reduction benefits that urban drivers enjoy. additionally, some communities may be disproportionately affected by unintended consequences, such as navigation systems diverting traffic onto residential roads, leading to increased noise, air pollution, and safety risks for local residents\u2014especially in low-income or minority neighborhoods that are already overburdened by traffic.\n\ntechnical challenges and interoperability issues are also significant barriers. different vehicle manufacturers use different standards for connected vehicle technology, meaning a toyota may not communicate effectively with a ford. this reduces the effectiveness of v2v systems, which rely on universal communication to share hazard alerts and traffic data. infrastructure interoperability is another issue: if one state uses a certain type of sensor or communication protocol, another state may use a different one, leading to gaps in service when drivers cross state lines. signal interference is also a problem in rural areas or urban canyons with poor cell service, where v2i communication may be spotty or non-existent, limiting the effectiveness of alerts and routing recommendations.\n\nin conclusion, advanced navigation technologies have the potential to revolutionize freeway navigability by reducing congestion, enhancing safety, and improving user experience. however, these benefits come with significant drawbacks, including high costs, privacy risks, driver complacency, equity issues, and technical challenges. to maximize the benefits while minimizing the harms, policymakers, engineers, and technology providers must work together to develop universal standards for connected vehicle technology, invest in affordable upgrades for older vehicles, implement strong data privacy protections, and ensure that rural and low-income communities are not left

{"prompt": "Write a follow-up email to state the most important reasons why your boss needs to consider your request for a raise.\n\nYour response should contain a postscript starting with P.P.S. Finish your entire response with this exact phrase: Hope you agree with me.", "response": "Subject: Follow-Up: Request for Salary Adjustment \u2013 Key Rationale  \n\nDear [Boss\u2019s Name],  \n\nI hope this email finds you well. Following our conversation last week about my request for a salary adjustment, I wanted to distill the most critical reasons for your consideration in writing, to ensure clarity and provide a reference as you evaluate the request.  \n\nFirst, over the past 18 months, I have consistently exceeded core performance targets by an average of 25% each quarter. For example, leading the Q3 client retention initiative resulted in a 15% reduction in churn and generated an additional $80k in recurring annual revenue\u2014outperforming the initial goal by 40%. This work directly contributed to our team hitting its annual revenue target two months ahead of schedule.  \n\nSecond, I have taken on significant responsibilities beyond the scope of my original job description. Since last year, I\u2019ve been the primary mentor for three new team members, reducing their onboarding time by 30% and helping them reach full productivity faster. I also now lead our cross-departmental weekly syncs with the product team, which has cut down miscommunication delays by 20% and improved the speed of feature launches for our key clients.  \n\nThird, my research into market salary data for roles with my level of experience, skill set, and industry track record shows that the average compensation is 18% higher than my current salary. Given my consistent contributions and the additional value I bring to the team, aligning my salary with this market standard would ensure I\u2019m fairly compensated for the work I do.  \n\nI remain deeply committed to driving success for our team and the company, and I believe a salary adjustment would not only recognize my past contributions but also motivate me to continue taking on impactful projects in the future.  \n\nP.P.S. Earlier this week, I received unsolicited feedback from our top client, GreenTech Solutions, specifically highlighting how my proactive support on their custom project helped them launch their new product three weeks early\u2014feedback they shared directly with the executive team. This is just one more example of the tangible value I deliver to our key stakeholders.  \n\nHope you agree with me."}

{"prompt": "Provide advice on how to approach writing college application essays, but do not mention highlighting personal strengths or achievements.\n\nThe very end of your response should read \"You cannot fail with the steps listed above.\" No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "Start by centering your essay on a micro-moment\u2014an unassuming, seemingly trivial experience that lingered in your mind long after it ended. This could be waiting for a delayed train while watching a street artist sketch passersby, overhearing a grandparent recount a forgotten childhood memory while peeling potatoes, or noticing how your neighborhood oak tree\u2019s branches shifted with each gust of wind during a storm. Focus on sensory details: the scratch of charcoal on paper, the soft thud of potato skins hitting a bowl, the creak of wood against wind. These specifics ground your story in reality and invite readers to see the world through your eyes, without relying on grand gestures or milestones.\n\nNext, dive into the internal shift sparked by that moment. Instead of highlighting actions you took or goals you met, explore how the experience altered your perspective. Maybe the street artist\u2019s focus on people no one else seemed to notice made you question why we often overlook the quiet, uncelebrated parts of daily life. Or your grandparent\u2019s story about walking miles to school in the snow made you reevaluate your own relationship to convenience and gratitude\u2014not as a lesson you mastered, but as a set of questions you now carry with you. Focus on the confusion, curiosity, or quiet doubt that arose, rather than any resolution or success.\n\nThen, connect that shift to the way you engage with the world now. Explain how that small moment changed the way you listen to friends, observe your surroundings, or approach new situations. For example, you might now pause to ask baristas about their day, or spend time sitting under that oak tree to notice how it changes with the seasons. This shows readers not what you\u2019ve achieved, but how you\u2019ve grown in your ability to notice, wonder, and connect.\n\nFinally, embrace vulnerability in your writing. Don\u2019t shy away from moments of uncertainty or even embarrassment. If you misjudged a stranger\u2019s intent after overhearing a snippet of conversation, write about that mistake and how it taught you to hold space for ambiguity. Vulnerability creates genuine connection; it lets readers see you as a thoughtful, evolving person rather than a curated list of achievements.\n\nYou cannot fail with the steps listed above."}
{"prompt": "Propose a sustainable manufacturing process for the sweatshirts.\n\nYour response should contain 5 or more sections. Highlight each section name using the format: *section name*", "response": "### Sustainable Manufacturing Process for Sweatshirts: A Circular, People-Centric Approach\n\n*Circular Raw Material Sourcing with Regenerative and Recycled Fibers*  \nThe foundation of sustainable sweatshirt production lies in prioritizing materials that minimize environmental harm and close the resource loop. We source 70% of fiber content from post-consumer recycled materials: 50% from rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate) derived from plastic water bottles (each sweatshirt repurposes 6\u20138 bottles) and 20% from recycled cotton collected via take-back programs. The remaining 30% comes from regenerative organic cotton grown using practices that sequester carbon, restore soil health, and eliminate synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. All materials are traceable via blockchain technology, allowing customers to scan a QR code to view the origin of their sweatshirt\u2019s fibers, from cotton farm to rPET processing facility. Certifications like GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and Recycled Claim Standard (RCS) validate material integrity.\n\n*Water and Energy-Efficient Fabric Production with Closed-Loop Systems*  \nTraditional textile manufacturing is water-intensive, so we implement closed-loop dyeing and finishing processes that recycle 95% of water and 90% of chemicals used in production. Low-impact, plant-based dyes (derived from indigo, turmeric, and pomegranate) replace toxic synthetic dyes, reducing water pollution and eliminating harmful byproducts. For weaving, we use air-jet looms that consume 30% less energy than conventional shuttle looms, while our fabric mills are powered by 100% renewable energy (solar panels on-site and wind farm partnerships). We also skip unnecessary chemical treatments like formaldehyde-based wrinkle resistance, opting instead for pre-washed fabrics that maintain softness without environmental harm.\n\n*Zero-Waste Pattern Cutting and Modular Assembly*  \nTo minimize fabric waste (a major issue in apparel manufacturing), we use AI-powered pattern nesting software that optimizes layout to reduce offcuts by 12\u201315% compared to manual cutting. Any remaining fabric scraps are upcycled into functional components: small offcuts become drawstrings, patch pockets, or decorative patches, while larger pieces are donated to local artisans for craft projects. We design sweatshirts with modularity in mind: cuffs, hems, and hood liners are detachable and replaceable, so customers can swap worn parts instead of discarding the entire garment. Assembly uses recycled polyester thread and water-based adhesives (instead of toxic glues) for non-sewn components, and all sewing machines are energy-efficient models with automatic shut-off features to reduce idle power use.\n\n*Transparent Ethical Labor Practices with Worker Wellbeing at the Core*  \nSustainability extends beyond the environment to social equity. We partner with manufacturing facilities certified by Fair Trade USA and B Corp, ensuring workers earn a living wage (150% of the local minimum) and have access to safe, well-ventilated workspaces with natural light. On-site benefits include free health clinics, childcare services, and skill-building programs (e.g., pattern design training) to empower workers. We limit overtime to 10 hours per month and establish worker-led committees to address feedback and improve conditions. For local manufacturing hubs, we reduce transportation emissions by producing sweatshirts within 500 miles of key markets, while global suppliers are required to publish annual social impact reports for full transparency.\n\n*Carbon-Neutral Logistics and Plastic-Free Packaging*  \nTo cut transportation emissions, we prioritize sea freight over air freight for international shipments (reducing CO\u2082 emissions by 90% per unit) and use electric delivery vans for local and last-mile distribution. All unavoidable emissions are offset via verified reforestation projects in deforested regions of the Amazon. Packaging is 100% plastic-free and compostable: sweatshirts are shipped in mailers made from recycled cardboard and mushroom mycelium insulation, with no plastic tags or tape. We also offer a \u201cno-packaging\u201d option for repeat customers, where sweatshirts are delivered in reusable cotton tote bags that can be returned for a discount on future purchases.\n\n*End-of-Life Circularity and Customer Engagement*  \nWe operate a take-back program where customers can return any worn or damaged sweatshirt for free. Returned garments are sorted: gently used ones are cleaned and resold via our secondhand platform (with 20% of proceeds going to environmental nonprofits), while damaged ones are shredded into fiber and recycled into new sweatshirt fabric (using chemical recycling for blended fibers that can\u2019t be mechanically processed). We also provide a free repair service for minor damages (rips, loose threads) at our local hubs, extending the average lifespan of each sweatshirt from 2 to 5 years. To educate customers, each sweatshirt includes a care guide with tips like cold-water washing, line drying, and avoiding dry cleaning to reduce its carbon footprint over time."}

{"prompt": "Describe some fascinating examples of similarities between humans and other animal species.\n\nYour response must highlight at least 5 sections by starting and ending with \"*\", like: *highlighted text section*.", "response": "While humans often distinguish ourselves by traits we once considered unique\u2014culture, empathy, complex communication\u2014scientific research continues to reveal that these characteristics are far more widespread across the animal kingdom than we ever imagined. The similarities between humans and other species are not just superficial; they reflect deep evolutionary connections and shared cognitive and emotional capacities. Here are some of the most fascinating examples:\n\n*Grief and Mourning Rituals*: Elephants are renowned for their profound responses to death. Researchers have observed herds lingering around the bodies of deceased members for hours or even days\u2014caressing bones with their trunks, touching skulls gently, and covering the body with leaves and branches. Chimpanzees also exhibit mourning behaviors: when a group member dies, others may sit quietly nearby, groom the body, or carry deceased infants for weeks after passing. Dolphins have been seen staying with dead pod members, pushing their bodies through the water as if trying to revive them. These actions go beyond instinct; they suggest a recognition of loss and an emotional connection to the deceased, mirroring the depth of human grief.\n\n*Cultural Transmission of Unique Traditions*: For decades, culture\u2014learned behaviors passed down through generations\u2014was thought to be exclusive to humans. But studies of chimpanzee communities have revealed distinct regional traditions: some groups use stone hammers to crack nuts, while others prefer wooden ones; some fish for termites with long, thin sticks, while others use shorter, thicker tools. Orcas offer another striking example: different pods have unique hunting techniques, such as the \"wave-washing\" method used by Antarctic orcas to knock seals off ice floes. This behavior is taught to young orcas by older members, not encoded in their genes. Even songbirds have regional dialects, with young birds learning their species\u2019 song from adult tutors, leading to unique vocal patterns in different areas.\n\n*Tool Creation and Forward-Thinking Problem-Solving*: Crows demonstrate extraordinary tool-making skills that rival some primates. In a famous experiment, a captive crow named Betty bent a straight piece of wire into a hook to retrieve a bucket of food from a tube\u2014a behavior she had never seen before, showing spontaneous innovation. Octopuses are also master tool users: they collect discarded coconut shells, carry them across the seafloor, and assemble them into protective shelters when threatened. Chimpanzees take tool-making a step further by modifying sticks into specialized termite-fishing tools, stripping leaves and sharpening the ends to extract insects from mounds. What\u2019s most fascinating is that some animals, like crows, can plan ahead\u2014storing tools for future use, a trait once thought to be uniquely human.\n\n*Empathetic and Altruistic Acts Without Reward*: Altruism\u2014acting to benefit another without personal gain\u2014is often considered a hallmark of human morality, but many animals exhibit this behavior. In a series of experiments, rats were shown to free trapped companions from a cage even when there was no food reward for doing so; some rats chose to help their cage mate over accessing a treat. Elephants frequently assist injured or distressed herd members: they use their trunks to lift fallen calves, guide blind elephants to water, and defend vulnerable members from predators. Dolphins are known for rescuing humans from drowning or shark attacks, as well as helping injured dolphins reach the surface to breathe. These acts suggest a capacity for empathy\u2014understanding and sharing the feelings of others\u2014that transcends species.\n\n*Complex Communication with Context and Nuance*: Animals communicate far more than basic needs; many species have systems with syntax, reference, and regional variation. Kanzi, a bonobo, learned to use over 300 lexigrams (symbolic representations of words) and could understand complex sentences like \"Put the ball on the banana\"\u2014a feat requiring grasp of grammar and object relationships. Dolphins have unique \"signature whistles\" that function like names; they use these whistles to call to one another, and even refer to other dolphins by their whistles when they\u2019re not present. Parrots like Alex, an African grey, could identify objects by color, shape, and number, and even express frustration when he couldn\u2019t solve a problem, showing his communication was rooted in understanding, not just mimicry.\n\n*Self-Awareness and Mirror Recognition*: The mirror self-recognition test (MSR) assesses self-awareness, and several species pass it: great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans), elephants, dolphins, and even some magpies. When marked with a non-toxic dye, these animals touch the mark on their own bodies while looking in a mirror, indicating they recognize their reflection as themselves rather than another animal. For example, elephants in a study touched a white X painted on their foreheads only when they could see it in a mirror, ignoring it when the mirror was covered. This sense of self was once thought to be exclusive to humans.\n\nThese similarities remind us that we are not separate from the animal kingdom, but part of it. Recognizing these shared traits fosters a deeper respect for the cognitive and emotional lives of other species, urging us to treat them with the compassion they deserve."}
{"prompt": "Describe the key features and benefits of the portable camera, but do not mention the camera's dimensions or weight.\n\nIn your response, capitalize a few words to stress main points. Please limit the number of words with all capital letters to less than four. Your response should contain at least ten sentences.", "response": "Portable cameras have become essential companions for anyone who wants to capture life\u2019s moments with greater clarity and artistry than a smartphone can offer. One standout feature is its ability to shoot 4K footage, which delivers crisp, detailed video that preserves every subtle nuance of a scene\u2014from the way sunlight filters through tree leaves to the soft smile on a loved one\u2019s face. This level of detail isn\u2019t just for professional filmmakers; it lets everyday users create content that feels polished and immersive, perfect for sharing on social media or compiling into personal documentaries. Another key feature is advanced image stabilization, which ensures that even when you\u2019re moving quickly or shooting in less-than-steady conditions, your photos and videos remain smooth and blur-free. This is especially valuable when shooting in LOW-LIGHT conditions, where even the best smartphones struggle to capture clear, noise-free images. Whether you\u2019re hiking along a winding trail, chasing a playful pet, or walking through a bustling city street after dark, this stabilization eliminates the shakiness that often plagues smartphone shots, resulting in professional-looking results without extra gear. Many portable cameras also come with interchangeable lenses, a feature that opens up a world of creative possibilities for users. You can swap between a wide-angle lens to capture sweeping landscapes or a prime lens to focus on intimate, close-up shots of flowers, food, or small details that might otherwise go unnoticed. This flexibility means you don\u2019t need to carry multiple bulky cameras; one portable device can adapt to any shooting scenario you encounter. A major benefit of these cameras is their dedicated manual controls, which let you adjust settings like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO to match your creative vision. Unlike smartphones, which often rely on automatic modes that can overexpose or underexpose shots, portable cameras give you full control over how light interacts with your subject, allowing you to create moody, dramatic photos or bright, airy ones with ease. Many models also include built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, making it simple to transfer your photos and videos directly to your phone or laptop for editing or sharing. No more fumbling with cables or memory card readers; you can send your favorite shots to social media platforms or cloud storage in just a few taps, ensuring you never miss a chance to share a special moment with friends and family. Another underrated benefit is the camera\u2019s durable build, designed to withstand the rigors of on-the-go use. Many models are dustproof, waterproof, and shockproof, so you can take them to the beach, on a ski trip, or into a rainy forest without worrying about damage from the elements. This durability means your camera can keep up with your adventures, whether you\u2019re exploring remote wilderness areas or navigating busy urban environments. Additionally, portable cameras often have longer battery life than smartphones when used for continuous shooting, so you don\u2019t have to cut your photo session short to find a charger. You can spend an entire day at a festival, a wedding, or a nature reserve capturing every important moment without the stress of your device dying halfway through. Finally, the dedicated viewfinder on many portable cameras helps you frame shots more accurately, especially in bright sunlight where smartphone screens can be hard to see. It lets you focus on your subject without distractions, helping you compose shots that are visually balanced and engaging. All these features combine to make a portable camera a versatile tool that enhances your ability to capture and preserve life\u2019s most precious moments with quality and creativity that goes far beyond what a smartphone can achieve."}
{"prompt": "What are the key factors that contribute to a successful and fulfilling marriage between two moms, and how can they maintain a strong and healthy relationship while raising children together?\n\nYour response should highlight at least 3 sections with markdown, i.e *highlighted section*.", "response": "A successful, fulfilling marriage between two moms combines universal pillars of healthy relationships with intentional practices that honor their unique identities, navigate specific societal challenges, and prioritize both their romantic bond and their children\u2019s well-being. Below are key factors and strategies organized into core areas:\n\n### **Centering Shared Values and Co-Creating a Unified Family Identity**\nThe foundation of any strong marriage is aligned values, but for two moms, this requires intentional co-creation of a family narrative that feels authentic to both partners and their children. This starts with ongoing, vulnerable conversations about core parenting principles: discipline styles, educational priorities, how to talk to kids about their family structure, and how to integrate cultural or personal traditions from both sides. For example, agreeing on whether to use distinct labels like \u201cMommy\u201d and \u201cMama\u201d or to embrace shared terms, or deciding how to celebrate holidays that may have been meaningful to each partner growing up.\n\nRespecting each other\u2019s individual identities alongside the family\u2019s collective identity is equally critical. One mom might identify as a working parent focused on career growth, while the other prioritizes full-time caregiving\u2014both contributions need validation without leaning into rigid stereotypes. Co-creating family rituals (weekly game nights, annual pride parade attendance, or cooking meals from each partner\u2019s heritage) reinforces a sense of belonging for everyone, helping kids see their family as rooted in love and shared purpose rather than societal norms. This alignment reduces conflict and fosters a harmonious home that supports both the marriage and the children\u2019s emotional safety.\n\n### **Proactively Navigating External Challenges as a Unified Front**\nTwo moms often face unique legal, social, and emotional barriers that straight couples may not encounter, and addressing these as a team is non-negotiable for long-term success. First, legal preparation is essential: securing second-parent adoption, co-parenting agreements, or power of attorney documents ensures both partners have equal legal rights to their children, even if one is not the biological parent. This step not only protects the family but also strengthens trust between the partners, knowing they\u2019ve taken steps to safeguard their bond and their kids\u2019 future.\n\nWhen facing microaggressions, discrimination, or misunderstanding (e.g., from school staff, strangers, or extended family), presenting a united front is key. For instance, if a teacher misgenders one partner, the couple can calmly correct them together and follow up with the school to educate staff on inclusive language. Supporting each other emotionally through these experiences\u2014checking in after a difficult interaction, validating each other\u2019s frustration, or offering a safe space to process stress\u2014reinforces that they are each other\u2019s first line of defense. For kids, this modeling of resilience teaches them to advocate for themselves and their family while surrounding them with a supportive community of LGBTQ+ families and allies.\n\n### **Prioritizing Mutual Care and Nurturing the Romantic Bond Beyond Parenting**\nParenting can easily overshadow the marital relationship, but two moms must intentionally carve out space to nurture their connection as partners, not just co-parents. This starts with equitable division of labor: since traditional gender roles don\u2019t dictate responsibilities, honest conversations about household tasks, childcare duties, and emotional labor (like scheduling doctor\u2019s appointments or managing school communications) are vital to prevent burnout. For example, creating a shared calendar to track who handles bedtime routines, grocery shopping, or parent-teacher conferences ensures no one feels overwhelmed.\n\nRegular, low-effort or intentional date nights\u2014whether a movie at home after the kids sleep, a coffee date during nap time, or a weekend getaway with a trusted caregiver\u2014help maintain the romantic spark. Beyond that, checking in on each other\u2019s needs outside of parenting is crucial: one mom might need alone time to pursue a hobby, while the other might crave more physical affection. Celebrating each other\u2019s milestones, big or small (a work promotion, a successful potty-training win with the kids, or a personal goal achieved), reinforces that they value each other as individuals, not just caregivers. This mutual care ensures both partners are emotionally available for each other and their children, creating a cycle of love and support that sustains the marriage for years to come.\n\nUltimately, the success of their marriage lies in balancing flexibility and intentionality\u2014adapting to the changing needs of their kids while never losing sight of the love and partnership that brought them together. By centering shared values, standing united against challenges, and nurturing their bond, two moms can build a marriage that is not only fulfilling for themselves but also provides a loving, stable foundation for their children to thrive."}
{"prompt": "Describe the steps to organize a fundraising event to raise awareness for a cause. Provide details on the planning process and promotion strategies.\n\nYour entire response must be wrapped in double quotation marks. Your response should have five sections, with the beginning of each section marked with Section X.", "response": "\"Section 1: Initial Strategy & Foundation\nThe first step to organizing a successful fundraising event for cause awareness is to lay a clear, purpose-driven foundation. Start by defining dual goals: a specific fundraising target (e.g., $15,000 for youth mental health resources) and measurable awareness metrics (e.g., 500 social media shares, 200 in-person attendees, 100 new newsletter subscribers). Next, identify your target audience\u2014this could include local community members, corporate partners, existing supporters, or niche groups (e.g., parents for a child hunger cause). Form a core team with specialized roles: an event coordinator, marketing lead, finance manager, and volunteer coordinator to distribute tasks evenly. Align the event theme with your cause to reinforce awareness; for example, a \"Walk for Water\" 5K for a clean water initiative, or a \"Storytelling Night\" for a literacy nonprofit. Finally, research legal requirements: secure fundraising permits, confirm tax-exempt status for donations (if applicable), and draft a transparent donor policy to build trust.\n\nSection 2: Event Planning & Logistics\nOnce the strategy is set, dive into detailed logistics to ensure the event is both functional and awareness-focused. First, select a venue that aligns with your theme and audience: a local park for an outdoor walk, a community center for a workshop, or a hybrid model (in-person space + Zoom for virtual attendees) to expand reach. Create a comprehensive budget that includes venue costs, marketing materials, guest speaker fees, catering, tech tools (e.g., virtual donation platforms), and a 10-15% contingency fund for unexpected expenses. Design activities that integrate cause awareness seamlessly: invite a beneficiary to share their personal story, host a workshop on how attendees can support the cause beyond donations, or a silent auction with items donated by local businesses (each item should include a blurb about the business\u2019s commitment to the cause). Partner with complementary nonprofits or local influencers to add credibility and expand your network.\n\nSection 3: Promotion & Outreach\nA multi-channel promotion strategy is key to driving attendance and awareness. Start with social media: create a dedicated event page on Facebook or Instagram, post teaser content (e.g., short videos of beneficiaries, behind-the-scenes planning reels), and use branded hashtags (e.g., #WalkForWater2024). Run targeted social ads to local audiences or users who follow similar causes. For email marketing, send personalized invites to existing supporters, corporate partners, and community groups, with regular updates on goal progress (e.g., \"We\u2019re 30% to our $15k target\u2014join us to help us reach the finish line!\"). Local outreach includes posting flyers in cafes, libraries, and community boards, and pitching to local newspapers, radio stations, and TV channels for free press coverage. Offer corporate sponsorship tiers (gold, silver, bronze) with benefits like logo placement on event materials or a speaking slot, encouraging businesses to promote the event to their employees.\n\nSection 4: On-Day Execution & Engagement\nOn the day of the event, prioritize smooth execution and meaningful engagement to reinforce cause awareness. For in-person attendees, set up a check-in station with volunteers who distribute event programs (including cause facts and donation impact statements) and branded swag (e.g., wristbands with the cause\u2019s slogan). For virtual attendees, start with a pre-event welcome video that highlights the cause\u2019s mission and shares a beneficiary story. Throughout the event, use real-time engagement tactics: live-stream speeches and activities on social media, host interactive polls (e.g., \"What\u2019s one small way you can support clean water access this week?\"), and display a digital tracker showing progress toward the fundraising goal. Ensure every activity ties back to awareness: a silent auction could include items with tags explaining how the funds from their purchase will directly help (e.g., \"This $100 art piece funds 50 days of clean water for a family of four\"). End the event with a clear call to action: ask attendees to share their experience on social media, sign up for the newsletter, or make a recurring donation.\n\nSection 5: Post-Event Follow-Up & Sustained Awareness\nThe work doesn\u2019t end when the event concludes\u2014follow-up is critical to maintain momentum and build long-term support. Within 48 hours, send personalized thank-you messages to attendees, donors, sponsors, and volunteers, including a recap of key highlights (total funds raised, number of attendees, impact stories shared). Publish a detailed impact report within 2-3 weeks that breaks down how funds will be allocated (e.g., 60% to direct services, 25% to community awareness campaigns, 15% to operational costs) and share this across your website, social media, and email newsletter. To sustain awareness, launch a post-event social media series: share updates on how donations are making a difference (e.g., photos of a community receiving clean water), host Q&As with beneficiaries, or invite attendees to join ongoing volunteer opportunities. Finally, gather feedback from attendees via a short survey to improve future events and strengthen your relationship with supporters.\""}
{"prompt": "What criteria should be included in a rubric to evaluate the overall performance of the conductor?\n\nYour response must be wrapped with double quotation marks. There should be exactly 6 paragraphs separated by the markdown divider: ***. In your response, use words with all capital letters (such as \"RUBRIC\") at least 5 times.", "response": "\"\nThe first critical criterion in any CONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE RUBRIC is Musical Interpretation and Artistic Vision. This section of the RUBRIC must assess how effectively the conductor translates the composer\u2019s written score into a cohesive, emotionally resonant performance that honors both COMPOSER INTENT and the conductor\u2019s unique artistic voice. Judges should evaluate whether the conductor balances fidelity to the score\u2014including adherence to tempo markings, dynamic ranges, and articulations\u2014with creative choices that enhance the work\u2019s narrative. Key indicators here include the ensemble\u2019s ability to convey consistent emotional tone across movements, the clarity of thematic development, and the overall unity of the performance\u2019s artistic message. A strong RUBRIC will assign weighted scores to this criterion, as it forms the core of a conductor\u2019s artistic identity.\n\n***\nNext, the CONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE RUBRIC must include a criterion focused on Ensemble Leadership and Communication. This evaluates the conductor\u2019s ability to guide and unify the ensemble through clear, intentional cues and non-verbal communication. Judges should look for ENSEMBLE SYNCHRONIZATION\u2014how well sections of the orchestra, choir, or band align in timing and dynamics\u2014and the conductor\u2019s responsiveness to the ensemble\u2019s needs. The RUBRIC should also assess whether the conductor fosters a collaborative environment where musicians feel empowered to contribute their own artistry while remaining aligned with the collective vision. Indicators include the precision of entry cues, the conductor\u2019s ability to adjust in real time to the ensemble\u2019s energy, and post-performance feedback from musicians about the conductor\u2019s leadership style.\n\n***\nTechnical Proficiency is another non-negotiable criterion in the CONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE RUBRIC. This section measures the conductor\u2019s mastery of fundamental technical skills, including baton technique, score reading, and dynamic control. Judges should evaluate the conductor\u2019s ability to execute clear, consistent baton gestures that communicate tempo, dynamics, and articulation without ambiguity. The RUBRIC must also assess SCORE COMPREHENSION\u2014whether the conductor demonstrates a deep understanding of the score\u2019s structural layers, harmonic progressions, and instrumental timbres. Key indicators here include the conductor\u2019s ability to maintain steady tempo through complex passages, the clarity of dynamic shifts, and the absence of technical errors that disrupt the ensemble\u2019s performance.\n\n***\nA comprehensive CONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE RUBRIC must include a criterion for Audience and Stakeholder Engagement. This evaluates how well the conductor connects with the audience beyond the performance itself, as well as their ability to collaborate with organizational stakeholders such as venue managers, artistic directors, and funding bodies. Judges should assess AUDIENCE RESONANCE\u2014whether the performance elicits a strong emotional response from attendees, measured through post-concert surveys or standing ovations. The RUBRIC should also consider the conductor\u2019s willingness to engage with the audience through pre-concert talks, meet-and-greets, or social media interactions, as well as their ability to align the ensemble\u2019s repertoire with the organization\u2019s strategic goals.\n\n***\nAdaptability and Problem-Solving are essential criteria in the CONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE RUBRIC, as live performances often present unexpected challenges. This section evaluates the conductor\u2019s ability to respond quickly and effectively to unforeseen issues, such as instrument malfunctions, ensemble errors, or sudden changes in venue conditions. Judges should look for REAL-TIME ADAPTATION\u2014whether the conductor can adjust tempo, dynamics, or even the performance\u2019s structure without disrupting the overall flow. The RUBRIC should also assess the conductor\u2019s ability to remain calm under pressure and reassure the ensemble, ensuring that the performance maintains its artistic integrity despite setbacks. Indicators include how smoothly the conductor navigates unexpected pauses, adjusts cues to accommodate a musician\u2019s mistake, or modifies the performance to suit a last-minute venue change.\n\n***\nFinally, the CONDUCTOR PERFORMANCE RUBRIC must include a criterion for Long-Term Ensemble Development. This evaluates the conductor\u2019s impact on the ensemble\u2019s growth and sustainability over time, rather than just individual performances. Judges should assess whether the conductor prioritizes SUSTAINABLE GROWTH by mentoring young musicians, expanding the ensemble\u2019s repertoire to include diverse works, and fostering a positive, inclusive artistic culture. The RUBRIC should measure the conductor\u2019s ability to build the ensemble\u2019s reputation through consistent, high-quality performances and to attract new audiences and funding sources. Key indicators here include the ensemble\u2019s improvement over multiple seasons, the number of new works added to their repertoire, and feedback from musicians about their professional development under the conductor\u2019s leadership.\n\""}
{"prompt": "Provide a detailed analysis on the movie La La Land that includes information about the film's themes, characters, and impact.\n\nWhenever the user inputs a request, please repeat the request itself exactly as it is, then give your reply. Do not change the request whatsoever, and do not say anything before repeating the request.", "response": "Provide a detailed analysis on the movie La La Land that includes information about the film's themes, characters, and impact.\n\n### Detailed Analysis of *La La Land* (2016)\nDirected by Damien Chazelle and starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, *La La Land* is a modern musical that blends classic Hollywood nostalgia with a bittersweet, realistic exploration of ambition, love, and regret. It emerged as a cultural touchstone upon its 2016 release, winning six Academy Awards (including Best Director for Chazelle) and revitalizing the mainstream musical genre. Below is a breakdown of its core themes, character arcs, and lasting impact:\n\n#### Core Themes\n1. **Dreams vs. the Cost of Ambition**  \nAt its heart, *La La Land* is a meditation on the struggle to pursue artistic dreams in a city built on rejection. Los Angeles itself functions as a character: a glittering backdrop where hopefuls like Mia and Sebastian face repeated setbacks\u2014Mia\u2019s botched auditions and flop one-woman show, Sebastian\u2019s failed attempts to open a jazz club. The film rejects the trope of \"overnight success,\" instead emphasizing that achievement often requires compromise: Mia abandons LA temporarily after her show fails, while Sebastian joins a pop-jazz band he despises to pay the bills. The final montage, which imagines a perfect timeline where their dreams and love align, underscores the painful truth that ambition can force impossible choices.\n\n2. **Bittersweet Love and Timing**  \nMia and Sebastian\u2019s romance is defined by missed moments and mutual growth, not a fairy-tale ending. They meet as outsiders (Mia is a barista on a studio lot; Sebastian is a struggling jazz pianist) and push each other to chase their goals: Sebastian encourages Mia to attend a life-changing audition, while Mia inspires Sebastian to stop compromising his jazz vision. Yet their timing is always off: when Mia\u2019s career takes off, Sebastian is tied to his band tour; when Sebastian finally opens his club, Mia is married with a child. The film\u2019s iconic final glance between them\u2014wordless, loaded with regret and quiet joy\u2014celebrates the idea that love can shape us even if it doesn\u2019t last forever.\n\n3. **Nostalgia and the Evolution of Hollywood**  \nChazelle pays homage to golden-age musicals (e.g., *Singin\u2019 in the Rain*, *The Umbrellas of Cherbourg*) through Technicolor palettes, long tracking shots, and fantasy sequences like the gravity-defying \"Planetarium\" dance. But he subverts nostalgia by grounding these moments in modern reality: the opening number \"Another Day of Sun\" is a chaotic, joyful celebration of LA\u2019s dreamers, but it\u2019s set on a gridlocked freeway, a nod to the city\u2019s unglamorous underbelly. The film also critiques Hollywood\u2019s commercialization: Mia\u2019s auditions reduce her to a one-line clich\u00e9, while Sebastian fights to preserve jazz from being watered down for mass appeal.\n\n4. **Artistic Integrity vs. Commercial Success**  \nSebastian\u2019s arc hinges on this tension. A self-proclaimed jazz purist, he refuses to play anything but traditional jazz\u2014until financial pressure leads him to join a pop-jazz band that prioritizes flash over substance. His conflict mirrors broader debates about art in capitalism: is it better to compromise your vision to survive, or to starve for your ideals? The film doesn\u2019t take a side; instead, it frames Sebastian\u2019s choice as a necessary step toward eventually opening his own club, where he can play the jazz he loves on his own terms.\n\n#### Character Analysis\n1. **Mia Dolan (Emma Stone)**  \nMia is a relatable everywoman, her vulnerability making her failures feel deeply personal. She\u2019s not a prodigy\u2014she forgets her lines in an audition, her one-woman show draws a tiny crowd\u2014but her resilience is her strength. Stone\u2019s performance captures the quiet despair of being overlooked (e.g., the scene where a casting director takes a call mid-audition) and the euphoria of finally being seen. By the end, Mia is a successful actress, but her success is tinged with the regret of what she lost along the way.\n\n2. **Sebastian Wilder (Ryan Gosling)**  \nSebastian is a passionate, stubborn idealist whose love for jazz is almost religious. Gosling\u2019s understated performance balances his gruff exterior with moments of softness (e.g., when he teaches Mia to play piano). His struggle to reconcile his vision with reality makes him a tragic figure: he hates the pop-jazz band, but it gives him the stability to pursue his club. His arc is about learning that compromise doesn\u2019t mean betrayal\u2014he can still honor jazz while adapting to the world.\n\n3. **The Symbiotic Dynamic**  \nMia and Sebastian are mirrors of each other. Both are outsiders fighting to be heard, and their relationship thrives on mutual respect for their ambitions. Unlike traditional musical couples, they don\u2019t \"complete\" each other; they push each other to become their best selves, even if that means going separate ways. Their final glance in Sebastian\u2019s club is a testament to this: they\u2019ve both achieved their dreams, and they\u2019re grateful for the role the other played in getting there.\n\n#### Cultural and Artistic Impact\n1. **Revitalizing the Mainstream Musical**  \nBefore *La La Land*, musicals were often niche or adapted from Broadway. Chazelle\u2019s original, screen-specific musical proved that the genre could resonate with modern audiences, spurring a wave of mainstream musicals like *The Greatest Showman* and *In the Heights*. Unlike those films, however, *La La Land*\u2019s bittersweet ending set it apart, proving that musicals could tackle complex emotions beyond joy and romance.\n\n2. **Technical Innovation**  \nThe film\u2019s technical craft set a new standard for musicals:\n   - **Long Takes**: The opening \"Another Day of Sun\" sequence is a single, 3-minute tracking shot that captures the chaos and energy of LA\u2019s dreamers.\n   - **Color Symbolism**: Chazelle uses color to mirror emotion: blue for Sebastian\u2019s melancholy, yellow for Mia\u2019s hope, red for their passionate romance.\n   - **Iconic Score**: Justin Hurwitz\u2019s original score (including \"City of Stars\" and \"Audition (The Fools Who Dream)\") won two Oscars and became a cultural phenomenon, blending jazz and orchestral music to reflect the film\u2019s themes.\n\n3. **Critical and Awards Success**  \n*La La Land* was nominated for a record-tying 14 Academy Awards, winning six (Best Director, Best Actress, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design). The infamous 2017 Oscar mix-up (where it was mistakenly announced as Best Picture before *Moonlight* was named the true winner) only amplified its cultural visibility.\n\n4. **Legacy as a Modern Classic**  \nBeyond its awards, *La La Land* resonated with audiences because it explores universal questions: What if I\u2019d made a different choice? Do we ever stop wondering about the paths not taken? Its blend of nostalgia and realism has cemented it as a modern classic, a film that celebrates the beauty of dreams while acknowledging their often-painful costs."}
{"prompt": "What is your interpretation of the meaning behind the quote?\n\nYour response should not contain any commas. Your response should have more than 800 words.", "response": "The quote I will explore in depth is a timeless moral caution attributed to Edmund Burke an 18th century thinker and political figure who dedicated his work to exploring the ties between individual action and collective well being The quote reads The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing At first glance this statement seems straightforward but its layers of meaning reveal profound truths about human nature collective responsibility and the fragile balance between order and chaos in any community\n\nFirst we must define what Burke meant by evil This term is often vague but in the context of Burke\u2019s work it refers not just to extreme acts of violence or cruelty but to any system or behavior that undermines the inherent dignity of individuals erodes the foundations of a just society or exploits the vulnerable Evil in this sense can take many forms It can be the quiet acceptance of unfair laws that favor the powerful over the poor It can be the spread of hate speech that dehumanizes marginalized groups It can be the refusal to speak up when someone is being harmed because it is easier to look away Burke\u2019s definition of evil is broad because he recognized that evil rarely arrives in a single dramatic moment It often creeps into society through small unchallenged acts that accumulate over time until they become a dominant force\n\nNext we must consider what Burke meant by good men This phrase is not limited to men in the literal sense It refers to any person who possesses a basic sense of moral integrity who recognizes the difference between right and wrong and who has the capacity to act on that recognition Good men are not necessarily heroes or leaders They are ordinary people who go about their daily lives but who have the potential to make a difference if they choose to do so Burke did not believe that moral responsibility was reserved for a select few He argued that every member of a community has a role to play in upholding its values and protecting its most vulnerable members\n\nThe most critical part of the quote is the idea that inaction is the necessary condition for evil\u2019s triumph Burke is not saying that inaction is the only cause of evil but that it is the one thing that allows evil to grow unchecked without resistance Evil cannot thrive when it is confronted when people speak out against it when they take steps to protect those who are at risk But when good people choose to do nothing evil is given free rein to spread This is because evil relies on the silence and complacency of the majority to maintain its power Those who perpetrate evil acts often do so because they believe no one will stop them They count on the fact that most people will prioritize their own comfort over the well being of others that they will fear retaliation or simply not care enough to act\n\nTo understand this better we can look at historical examples that illustrate Burke\u2019s point One of the most striking examples is the rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s and 1940s Many ordinary Germans who were not themselves Nazis chose to do nothing as the regime implemented discriminatory laws targeted Jewish people and eventually carried out the Holocaust They may have disagreed with what was happening but they did not speak out They did not join resistance movements They did not offer help to those who were being persecuted Their inaction allowed the Nazi regime to consolidate its power and commit unspeakable atrocities Another example is the civil rights movement in the United States Many white Americans who believed in equality chose to remain silent as Black people faced segregation violence and disenfranchisement Their inaction prolonged the suffering of millions and delayed the progress of justice for decades\n\nBut it is not just large scale historical events that demonstrate the truth of Burke\u2019s quote It is also visible in small everyday interactions If someone is being bullied in a classroom and other students choose to watch instead of intervening the bullying is likely to continue If a coworker is being harassed by a supervisor and other employees say nothing the harassment will only get worse If a neighbor is struggling with poverty and no one offers to help their situation will not improve In each of these cases the inaction of good people allows harm to persist It sends a message to the perpetrator that their behavior is acceptable and to the victim that they are alone\n\nBurke\u2019s quote also speaks to the psychological reasons why good people choose to do nothing One of the most common reasons is the bystander effect This is a psychological phenomenon where people are less likely to act in an emergency or a situation of harm when there are other people present They assume that someone else will take responsibility that they do not need to get involved Another reason is fear People may be afraid of retaliation from the perpetrator They may fear losing their job their social status or even their safety if they speak out They may also fear being judged by others for interfering in a situation that is not their business A third reason is apathy Some people simply do not care enough about the suffering of others to act They are so focused on their own lives and their own problems that they do not notice or do not care about what is happening to those around them\n\nBut Burke\u2019s quote is not just a warning It is also a call to action It reminds us that we all have a responsibility to stand up against evil no matter how small or large it may be It tells us that our inaction is not harmless It is a choice that has real consequences for the people around us It encourages us to overcome our fear our apathy and our tendency to rely on others to act It reminds us that even small acts of courage can make a difference A single person speaking out against injustice can inspire others to do the same A single act of kindness can break the cycle of harm and give hope to someone who is suffering\n\nWe must also recognize that doing something does not always mean taking dramatic or risky action It can mean speaking up when we hear someone make a discriminatory joke It can mean offering to help a neighbor who is struggling It can mean voting for political leaders who prioritize justice and equality It can mean donating to organizations that help those in need It can mean educating ourselves about the issues that affect our community and sharing that knowledge with others Every small act of resistance against evil helps to weaken its power and build a more just and compassionate society\n\nAnother important layer of meaning in Burke\u2019s quote is the idea that evil is not an external force that exists outside of society It is something that is perpetuated by the choices of ordinary people It is not just the fault of the perpetrators It is also the fault of those who choose to do nothing This is a difficult truth to accept because it means that we are all complicit in the evil that exists in our world if we do not take steps to stop it But it is also an empowering truth because it means that we all have the power to make a difference We do not have to wait for leaders or heroes to act We can take action ourselves in our own lives and in our own communities\n\nBurke\u2019s quote is more relevant today than ever before In a world where social media allows hate speech to spread quickly where political polarization divides communities where many people feel disconnected from the suffering of others it is easy to fall into complacency It is easy to think that our actions do not matter that we cannot make a difference But Burke\u2019s quote reminds us that this is not true Every time we choose to act instead of doing nothing we are pushing back against evil we are upholding the values of justice and compassion we are building a better world for ourselves and for future generations\n\nIn conclusion the meaning behind Burke\u2019s quote is both a warning and a call to action It warns us that the silence and complacency of good people is the greatest ally of evil It calls on us to recognize our collective responsibility to stand up against injustice to protect the vulnerable and to uphold the values that make our societies worth living in It reminds us that we are not powerless that even small acts of courage can have a big impact It is a message that we should carry with us every day in every aspect of our lives because the fate of our communities and our world depends on the choices we make to act or to do nothing"}
{"prompt": "Provide a detailed explanation of the biological processes that allow banana peels to be so slippery and cause people to slip and fall when stepped on. Describe the chemical composition and physical properties of the peel that contribute to its slippery nature. Also, discuss how the peel's color and texture may camouflage it and make it harder to notice on the ground, increasing the likelihood of slips and falls.\n\nYour response should contain the word \"disappointed\" at least 2 times. At least six sections should be highlighted with markdown, i.e *banana peel*.", "response": "### *Biological Origins of the Slippery Layer*\nBanana peels (from species of the *Musa* genus) owe their slipperiness to ripening-related biological processes. As bananas mature, enzymes like pectinase and cellulase are activated, breaking down the rigid pectin and cellulose structures in the peel\u2019s epidermal cell walls. This breakdown releases a gel-like mucilage\u2014a slimy substance that accumulates between the peel\u2019s outer cuticle and underlying tissue. For wild bananas, this layer evolved to protect the fruit from pests during ripening, but for humans, it becomes a hazard. As the peel softens further, stepping on it squeezes this mucilage out, creating a thin, lubricating film between the peel, shoe sole, and ground.\n\n### *Chemical Composition of the Peel's Slippery Matrix*\nThe slippery layer of a ripe banana peel is a complex mix of organic compounds. Pectin, a polysaccharide made of galacturonic acid chains, is the primary component; when broken down, it forms a hydrated gel with extremely low shear strength. Hemicellulose and small amounts of cuticular lipids add to the lubricity: lipids repel water, reducing friction between the peel and dry surfaces, while the water-rich pectin gel acts as a cushion that dissipates force when stepped on. Together, these compounds create a matrix that turns even a light step into a slip-inducing event. Studies have shown that this matrix can reduce the coefficient of friction (CoF) to as low as 0.07\u2014comparable to ice, and far below the 0.5 CoF considered safe for walking.\n\n### *Physical Properties That Amplify Slipperiness*\nBeyond chemistry, the peel\u2019s physical traits make it uniquely hazardous. Ripe peels are thin and flexible, allowing them to conform perfectly to the shape of shoe soles and underlying surfaces (like concrete or tile). This maximizes the contact area between the slippery mucilage film and the two surfaces, ensuring that almost no friction is generated. When pressure is applied, the peel\u2019s cells rupture, releasing more mucilage and creating a continuous lubricating layer. Even dry peels can be slippery if they\u2019ve been exposed to moisture, as water dissolves residual pectin and spreads it into a thinner, more uniform film.\n\n### *Camouflage via Color: Hiding in Plain Sight*\nOne of the reasons banana peels cause so many slips is their ability to blend with common surfaces, leaving us disappointed when we fail to spot them. Green unripe peels blend with grass or leafy backgrounds, while yellow ripe peels match sun-dappled concrete, fallen autumn leaves, or even the warm tones of indoor linoleum. As peels overripen to brown, they mimic dirt, mulch, or dead foliage\u2014surfaces we\u2019re conditioned to ignore. Our brains are wired to focus on unusual objects, so a peel that matches its surroundings often goes unnoticed until it\u2019s too late.\n\n### *Texture Matching: Blending with Surfaces*\nThe peel\u2019s texture also plays a key role in camouflage. Ripe peels have a smooth, slightly glossy surface that mirrors the finish of polished floors or wet pavement. When flattened on the ground, they don\u2019t create a noticeable bump or irregularity, unlike debris like twigs or paper. On sidewalks, the peel\u2019s thin, flexible texture allows it to lie flush with cracks or uneven concrete, making it nearly invisible to hurried pedestrians. This texture matching means we often step on peels without a second thought, leaving us disappointed when we lose our balance unexpectedly.\n\n### *Why We're Often Disappointed by Unseen Peels*\nMost slips on banana peels are not just accidents\u2014they\u2019re the result of a perfect storm of camouflage and human inattention. We\u2019re often disappointed because we assume public spaces are free of such obvious hazards, and we\u2019re even more disappointed when we realize the peel was right in front of us, hidden by its color and texture. Our brains prioritize moving efficiently over scanning for small, blended objects, so we miss the peel until our feet slide out from under us. This disappointment is amplified by the silly, avoidable reputation of banana peel slips, making the fall feel more embarrassing than other accidents.\n\n### *Evolutionary Context: Why Bananas Have Such Peels*\nWhile we may be disappointed by the hazard, the slippery peel serves an evolutionary purpose for wild bananas. The mucilage layer helps disperse seeds: when animals step on a ripe peel, the slime can stick to their fur or feet, carrying the banana\u2019s seeds to new locations. Additionally, the tough outer peel and slippery mucilage deter herbivores from eating the peel before the fruit inside is fully ripe. For cultivated bananas, which are often seedless, this trait is a leftover from their wild ancestors\u2014one that now plagues grocery stores, sidewalks, and kitchens worldwide.\n\nIn the end, the banana peel\u2019s slipperiness is a perfect example of how evolutionary adaptations can become human nuisances. We\u2019re repeatedly disappointed by unseen peels, but understanding their biology, chemistry, and camouflage can help us stay vigilant\u2014and maybe avoid that embarrassing slip."}

{"prompt": "Explain how the Earth's tilt causes seasons in simple terms.\n\nYour response should add a postscript starting with P.S. at the end.", "response": "Earth tilts on its axis at about 23.5 degrees\u2014think of it like a top spinning slightly off-kilter instead of straight up and down. As it orbits the Sun every year, this tilt means different parts of the planet face the Sun more directly at different times.\n\nWhen your hemisphere (say, the Northern one) tilts toward the Sun, sunlight hits it in a concentrated, direct beam\u2014like holding a flashlight straight at a piece of paper. This makes days longer and the air warmer, so we get summer. At the same time, the Southern Hemisphere tilts away, so sunlight hits it at a shallow angle (like tilting the flashlight sideways). The light spreads out, days are shorter, and it\u2019s cooler\u2014winter there.\n\nHalfway between these extremes, Earth\u2019s tilt is sideways to the Sun. Both hemispheres get equal amounts of sunlight, with days and nights roughly the same length. That\u2019s when we have spring or fall, depending on which hemisphere you\u2019re in.\n\nP.S. A common myth is that seasons come from Earth being closer or farther from the Sun. But Earth\u2019s orbit is almost a perfect circle\u2014our distance from the Sun barely changes. The tilt is the real cause! In fact, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun when Earth is closest to the Sun (early January)."}
{"prompt": "Describe a fantastical adventure where a brave knight embarks on a quest to slay a fearsome dragon guarding a hidden treasure.\n\nYour response must contain the word 'replied' at least twice.", "response": "Sir Kael of the Silver Crest adjusted the strap of his father\u2019s dented sword, his boots crunching over frost-covered stones as he climbed the Frostspine Peaks. Below, the village of Eldermist lay gasping\u2014crops withered to dust, children\u2019s coughs echoing through empty streets, the very air thick with a stagnant curse. The elder had told him the only cure was the Heart of the Grove, a glowing crystal relic guarded by Vorath, the Scaled Warden, a dragon whose roar could shake the peaks themselves.\n\nThree days later, Kael stood before the dragon\u2019s lair: a mouth of jagged crystal, pulsing with soft green light. He stepped inside, and the air grew warm, scented with pine and burnt honey. Suddenly, a shadow blotted out the light. Vorath emerged, his scales like polished obsidian, eyes burning like molten amber, wings unfurling to brush the cave\u2019s ceiling. Kael drew his sword, his voice steady despite the tremor in his hands. \u201cI am Sir Kael of Eldermist. I have come for the Heart of the Grove to lift my village\u2019s curse.\u201d\n\nVorath let out a low, rumbling laugh that shook loose pebbles from the cave walls. \u201cFoolish knight, do you think you\u2019re the first to come for the Heart?\u201d he replied, his voice like grinding stone. \u201cMany have charged in here, blades raised, only to become part of my collection of broken swords and bleached bones. You are no different.\u201d\n\nKael did not lunge. Instead, he lowered his sword, his gaze unwavering. \u201cI am not here to steal it,\u201d he said. \u201cI am here to return it to the Eldergrove, where it belongs. My village is dying, and the elder says the Heart\u2019s absence is the cause.\u201d\n\nVorath tilted his head, his amber eyes narrowing. For a long moment, the only sound was the distant drip of water and the faint glow of the Heart. \u201cReturn it?\u201d he replied, this time his tone softer, laced with curiosity. \u201cMost knights who come here see only power or gold. What makes you think you can be trusted with something so sacred?\u201d\n\nKael reached into his pouch and pulled out a crumpled cloth, unfolding it to reveal a small, wilted wildflower\u2014his sister\u2019s favorite, picked from her windowsill before she fell ill. \u201cMy sister is dying,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cI don\u2019t care about glory or treasure. I just want to save her, and everyone else in Eldermist. The Heart isn\u2019t a prize to me; it\u2019s a lifeline.\u201d\n\nVorath studied the flower, then looked back at Kael. Slowly, he lowered his head, his snout inches from the knight\u2019s face. \u201cYou speak the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Heart was stolen from the Eldergrove by a greedy king a century ago, who corrupted it with his ambition. I took it back to protect it from those who would misuse it, but its absence has indeed cursed your village. To return it, you must swear to guard it with your life, and never let it fall into the hands of someone who would exploit its power.\u201d\n\nKael knelt, pressing his forehead to the cold stone. \u201cI swear it,\u201d he said.\n\nVorath stepped aside, revealing the Heart of the Grove: a glowing green crystal the size of a fist, floating above a bed of moss. Kael picked it up gently, and warmth spread through his fingers, as if the crystal itself was alive. Together, they descended the peaks\u2014Kael walking beside the dragon, the Heart glowing between them. When they reached the Eldergrove, Kael placed the Heart in the center of the ancient oak, and instantly, the forest burst to life: leaves unfurled, flowers bloomed, and the air filled with the sweet scent of rain.\n\nBack in Eldermist, the crops began to grow, the sick recovered, and laughter returned to the streets. The villagers hailed Kael as a hero, but he always told them the real hero was Vorath. \u201cHe didn\u2019t guard the Heart out of malice,\u201d Kael would say. \u201cHe guarded it out of love for the land.\u201d\n\nAnd whenever the village faced a threat, a shadow would pass over the peaks, and the villagers would smile\u2014knowing their dragon guardian was watching over them."}

{"prompt": "Provide guidance on composing a Chinese poem that captures the essence of nature, without mentioning specific poetic forms or rhyme schemes. Your response should consist of at least 6 sentences.\n\nYour response should explicitly add a note starting with \"P.S.\" at the end.", "response": "To compose a Chinese poem that captures the essence of nature, begin by immersing yourself fully in the natural world, not as a passive observer but as a participant. Spend time in a single spot\u2014perhaps a quiet corner of a bamboo grove, a sun-dappled stream bank, or a hilltop at dusk\u2014and let your senses take over: feel the coolness of moss under your palms, listen to the faint rustle of a lizard scurrying through dry leaves, inhale the earthy scent of pine mixed with the sweet tang of wild berries. This presence allows you to notice the intimate, overlooked details that hold the true spirit of nature, rather than relying on generic descriptions of grand landscapes.\n\nNext, translate these sensory experiences into vivid, concrete imagery that evokes feeling without spelling it out. Instead of writing \u201cthe forest is quiet,\u201d describe how the only sound is the slow drip of water from a pine needle to the ground, and how that drip feels like a heartbeat, steady and unhurried. Avoid abstract words like \u201cbeautiful\u201d or \u201cpeaceful\u201d; let the details speak for themselves: the way sunlight filters through bamboo leaves to paint thin gold lines on the forest floor, the way a fallen chestnut shell crunches under your boot, releasing a nutty aroma that lingers in the air.\n\nCapture the rhythm and transience of nature to add depth to your poem. Notice the small cycles: the way a spider weaves its web at dawn, only to repair it after a midday rain; the slow unfurling of a lotus bud as the sun climbs higher; the fleeting flight of a kingfisher, its blue feathers flashing like a spark before it disappears into the reeds. These moments of change remind us of life\u2019s impermanence, and weaving them into your poem gives it a quiet resonance that connects with readers on a deeper level.\n\nDon\u2019t force a message or moral onto the natural world; instead, let the details guide your thoughts and emotions. If you watch a leaf float down a stream, don\u2019t immediately frame it as a symbol of sadness or loss. Instead, describe how it spins gently, carried by the current, how it brushes against a smooth stone before continuing its journey, and let those observations lead you to whatever quiet reflection arises\u2014whether it\u2019s about letting go, or the beauty of going with the flow.\n\nPlay with subtle contrasts to make your poem feel alive and dynamic. Pair the softness of dandelion fluff sticking to your sleeve with the rough texture of a weathered stone wall; the loud, sharp call of a cicada in the midday heat with the hush of a valley as the sun sets; the bright red of a wild apple against the muted green of a forest floor. These contrasts create tension and draw the reader\u2019s eye to the richness of the natural world, making your poem feel more vivid and memorable.\n\nFinally, let your own voice shine through. Your unique perspective\u2014whether you\u2019re someone who finds comfort in the quiet of a winter forest or joy in the chaos of a summer meadow\u2014will give your poem authenticity. Don\u2019t try to mimic ancient poets; instead, write from your own experience of nature, the moments that stuck with you, the small wonders that made you pause and look closer.\n\nP.S. After drafting your poem, set it aside for a day or two, then come back to it with fresh eyes. Read it aloud and ask yourself: does this make me feel like I\u2019m standing in that exact spot, breathing the same air, hearing the same sounds? If any line feels forced or out of place, replace it with something more organic\u2014let the poem flow as naturally as the world it describes."}

That\u2019s Gandalf, the coolest, kindest, and bravest wizard in all of Middle-earth.\n\nGandalf isn\u2019t just any old wizard, though. He\u2019s a special spirit sent from the stars to help ordinary folks stand up to Sauron, the big bad dark lord who wanted to take over the whole world with his evil Ring of Power. Gandalf has a knack for finding the smallest, unlikeliest heroes\u2014like hobbits, who are tiny, love eating, and usually hate leaving their cozy holes. \n\nWhen the War of the Ring started, Gandalf was right in the middle of it all:\n1. **The Shire Quest**: He noticed Bilbo\u2019s magic Ring was actually Sauron\u2019s lost evil Ring, so he helped Frodo, Bilbo\u2019s nephew, set off on a dangerous journey to destroy it. He even tricked a grumpy dragon (Smaug) once, but that\u2019s another story!\n2. **The Mines of Moria**: When Frodo\u2019s group got trapped in a dark mine full of orcs, Gandalf fought a fire-breathing monster called a Balrog\u2014think a giant demon made of flames and rock! He yelled, \u201cYou shall not pass!\u201d and pushed the Balrog into a deep pit, but fell in too. Everyone thought he was gone\u2026 but he came back stronger as Gandalf the White, with a shiny white hat and even more magic to fight Sauron.\n3. **Helm\u2019s Deep**: When thousands of evil orcs attacked a tiny mountain fortress called Helm\u2019s Deep, Gandalf rode in on Shadowfax\u2014the fastest horse in the world\u2014with a whole army of riders. He waved his staff, lit up the dark sky, and scared the orcs so bad they ran away.\n4. **The Battle of the Pelennor Fields**: When Sauron\u2019s huge elephant-like monsters (called oliphants) and endless orcs attacked the city of Minas Tirith, Gandalf led the charge. He rode Shadowfax through the chaos, shouting encouragement to the soldiers, and helped turn the tide of the battle.\n5. **The Black Gate Trick**: To give Frodo time to sneak into Mount Doom and destroy the Ring, Gandalf and a small group of heroes marched straight to Sauron\u2019s front door\u2014the Black Gate. They distracted Sauron\u2019s massive army, making him think they were going to fight him head-on, while Frodo did the real, secret work.\n\nGandalf\u2019s superpower wasn\u2019t just his magic\u2014it was believing in people. He knew that even the smallest hobbit could save the world if they were brave enough. He loved eating with hobbits, telling them stories, and setting off fireworks that looked like dragons and shooting stars. And when the war was over, he went back to the stars, but not before saying goodbye to his friends in the Shire\u2014with a promise that he\u2019d always be there if they needed him.\n\nSo if you ever feel small or scared, remember Gandalf: he thought the little guys could do big things, and he was right!>>"}
{"prompt": "Describe the next steps world leaders could take to address the alien invasion.\n\nYour response should contain exactly six paragraphs. The second paragraph must start with the word \"President\". Separate paragraphs by double line breaks (\"\\n\\n\").", "response": "The first critical step for world leaders is to immediately suspend all geopolitical rivalries and activate a pre-negotiated global coalition focused solely on addressing the alien invasion. This means setting aside trade disputes, border conflicts, and ideological divides to form a unified command structure that integrates military, scientific, and humanitarian efforts across nations. Leaders should direct their intelligence agencies to share real-time data on alien vessel movements, attack patterns, and observed capabilities, ensuring no country acts on incomplete or isolated information. This coalition must be led by a rotating council of representatives from diverse regions to avoid dominance by any single power, fostering trust and equitable participation in decision-making.\n\nPresident of the United Nations General Assembly must immediately convene an emergency special session, bypassing procedural red tape to pass a binding resolution mandating all member states to contribute military, scientific, and humanitarian resources to a centralized task force. The resolution should outline clear roles: nuclear-armed nations will provide defensive deterrence capabilities, but only under strict oversight to prevent premature escalation that could trigger full-scale war. Tech-leading countries will allocate their top engineers and computer scientists to decode alien communication systems and develop countermeasures against their advanced weaponry. Additionally, the resolution must establish a global misinformation task force to combat false narratives that could incite public panic or undermine collective action.\n\nWorld leaders must prioritize unprecedented scientific collaboration to unlock the mysteries of the alien threat. They should direct their premier scientific institutions\u2014from CERN and the Max Planck Institute to the Chinese Academy of Sciences and India\u2019s Department of Science and Technology\u2014to form a joint research consortium with a single mandate: to understand the aliens\u2019 motives, decode their technology, and establish non-hostile communication channels. This consortium will deploy unmanned drones and probes to study alien vessels up close, analyze their energy sources, and test potential translation algorithms for any detectable signals. Leaders should also allocate emergency funding to accelerate research into adaptive materials and energy shields that can protect critical infrastructure from alien attacks.\n\nHumanitarian and civil defense coordination is another non-negotiable step for world leaders. They must work together to establish global evacuation protocols for high-risk areas, such as major urban centers and military installations, and coordinate the distribution of food, water, and medical supplies to regions devastated by alien incursions. International safe zones should be designated in remote, geographically isolated regions\u2014like the Amazon rainforest, the Sahara Desert, and Antarctica\u2014with shared security and resource management to ensure civilian survival. Leaders should also launch a unified public information campaign, using trusted local and global figures to educate populations on emergency procedures, dispel rumors, and maintain social order during the crisis.\n\nTo avoid missteps in diplomatic engagement, world leaders must appoint a single, neutral envoy to initiate contact with the alien forces. This envoy should be a respected figure with no ties to any major power\u2014perhaps a Nobel Prize-winning scientist or a retired humanitarian leader\u2014who can carry a unified message from all of humanity: a desire for peaceful dialogue, a request for clarity on the aliens\u2019 intentions, and a firm statement that humanity will defend itself if threatened. Unilateral contact by any individual nation must be prohibited, as it could be misinterpreted as a provocation or create divisions within the global coalition. Leaders should also engage with marginalized communities and non-state actors to ensure their perspectives are included in diplomatic strategy, as their unique knowledge of local environments could prove invaluable.\n\nFinally, world leaders must plan for long-term resilience, even if the immediate alien threat is contained. They should establish a permanent Global Alien Defense Agency, funded by mandatory contributions from all member states, to monitor space for future incursions and develop universal defensive technologies. This agency will also serve as a hub for ongoing scientific collaboration, ensuring humanity remains prepared for any existential threat from beyond Earth. Moreover, leaders should use this crisis as a catalyst to strengthen global governance, reforming international institutions to respond more quickly to shared challenges and reduce geopolitical tensions that could weaken collective action in the future. The alien invasion, while devastating, offers an opportunity to build a more unified and resilient world."}

{"prompt": "Describe how to train a GAN model and its challenges.\n\nYour response must not contain any commas. End your response with a postscript indicated by P.P.S. Include the keywords \"lacking\", \"model\", \"performance\", \"quality\", \"architecture\".", "response": "To train a GAN model you first design the generator and discriminator architectures. The generator takes random noise as input and produces synthetic data while the discriminator classifies input data as real or fake. You initialize both models with suitable weights and select a loss function typically binary cross-entropy for the discriminator\u2019s classification task and an adversarial loss for the generator.\n\nNext you start the alternating training process. First you train the discriminator on a batch of real data and a batch of fake data generated by the current generator. You compute the loss for real data where the target label is 1 and for fake data where the target label is 0 then update the discriminator\u2019s weights to minimize this combined loss.\n\nThen you freeze the discriminator\u2019s weights and train the generator. You generate a new batch of fake data pass it through the discriminator and calculate the loss based on how effectively the generator fooled the discriminator with the target label set to 1 for the fake data. You update the generator\u2019s weights to minimize this loss.\n\nYou repeat these alternating training steps over many epochs until the generator produces synthetic data of satisfactory quality and the discriminator can no longer reliably tell real data apart from fake data.\n\nKey challenges in GAN training include mode collapse where the generator produces a narrow range of synthetic data lacking diversity which severely reduces the overall quality of outputs. Unstable training dynamics are another major issue where either the discriminator becomes too dominant making the generator unable to learn or the generator outperforms the discriminator leading to the discriminator\u2019s performance dropping to random guesses. A poorly chosen architecture can worsen these problems as an ill-fitted model structure may fail to capture the complex patterns in real data resulting in subpar performance and low quality synthetic data. Additionally training requires careful hyperparameter tuning as even small misconfigurations can disrupt the balance between the two models and hinder progress.\n\nP.P.S. Regular evaluation of both models during training helps identify issues like lacking diversity early and adjusting the architecture or training parameters can significantly improve overall performance and the quality of synthetic outputs."}
{"prompt": "Describe the key events in Benjamin Franklin's life that shaped his legacy. Then compose a short poem highlighting his most remarkable achievements and contributions.\n\nYour response should contain an essay and a poem, separated by 6 asterisk symbols: ******", "response": "Benjamin Franklin\u2019s legacy as America\u2019s quintessential Renaissance man was forged by a series of pivotal events that blended self-education, community service, scientific curiosity, and statesmanship. Each chapter of his life reflected a commitment to both individual growth and collective progress, cementing his reputation as a figure who turned ideas into tangible, lasting change.\n\nFranklin\u2019s journey began in 1723, when the 17-year-old printer\u2019s apprentice ran away from his oppressive father in Boston to Philadelphia. This act of rebellion set the stage for his identity as a self-made man: he taught himself to write eloquently, mastered the printing trade, and in 1732 began publishing *Poor Richard\u2019s Almanack*. Filled with practical proverbs like \u201cA penny saved is a penny earned,\u201d the almanack became a colonial staple, spreading accessible wisdom and making Franklin a household name. This early success established his belief that knowledge and hard work could lift both individuals and communities.\n\nBy 1727, Franklin had founded the Junto, a weekly club of working men dedicated to mutual improvement. From this group emerged some of America\u2019s first public institutions: the Library Company of Philadelphia (1731), the nation\u2019s first subscription library, which democratized access to books for those outside the elite; a volunteer fire department; and an academy that evolved into the University of Pennsylvania. In 1737, he was appointed postmaster of Philadelphia, where he reformed the colonial postal system, creating a network of post roads and standardized routes that connected the colonies more efficiently than ever before. These initiatives revealed Franklin\u2019s core philosophy: that a thriving society depends on shared investment in its people and infrastructure.\n\nFranklin\u2019s scientific breakthroughs in the 1750s catapulted him to international fame. His experiments with electricity\u2014most famously the 1752 kite experiment, which proved lightning is a form of electrical discharge\u2014revolutionized understanding of natural phenomena. He invented the lightning rod to protect buildings from strikes, a device that saved countless lives and property. This work earned him honorary degrees from European universities and made him a respected figure in intellectual circles across the Atlantic, a reputation that would prove invaluable in his later diplomatic career.\n\nAs tensions between the colonies and Britain escalated, Franklin transitioned from community builder to revolutionary statesman. In 1775, he joined the Second Continental Congress and played a key role in drafting the Declaration of Independence, lending his rhetorical skill and moral authority to the document. Sent to France in 1776 to secure military and financial support, Franklin\u2019s charm, wit, and international acclaim won over the French court. The 1778 Treaty of Alliance he negotiated was a turning point in the Revolutionary War, providing the colonies with the resources needed to defeat Britain. Later, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Paris (1783), which formally ended the war and recognized American independence.\n\nIn his final years, Franklin continued to shape the young nation. At the 1787 Constitutional Convention, his wisdom and compromise were instrumental in resolving the deadlock between large and small states over representation. His advocacy for the Great Compromise\u2014establishing a bicameral legislature\u2014helped unify the delegates and secure the ratification of the Constitution. Even as he neared death, he pushed for social justice, signing a petition to the First Congress calling for the abolition of slavery, a cause he had embraced late in life.\n\nFranklin\u2019s legacy is not defined by a single achievement but by his ability to excel in every sphere he touched.

Separate the paragraphs with ***.", "response": "The first step in managing individual income taxes is to gather all relevant financial documents, including W-2 forms from employers, 1099s for freelance or investment income, and receipts for eligible deductions like charitable contributions or medical expenses. Next, decide whether to take the standard deduction (a fixed amount set by the government) or itemize deductions, whichever reduces your taxable income more. Once you have your adjusted gross income (AGI) by subtracting above-the-line deductions from your total gross income, you can calculate your tax liability using the applicable tax brackets for your filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc.). Many taxpayers use free online calculators or tax preparation software to streamline this process, ensuring accuracy and helping identify any credits or additional deductions they may qualify for, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit or child tax credit.\n\n***\n\nAfter finalizing your tax liability calculation, the next critical step is to file your tax return. Most taxpayers opt for electronic filing (e-filing), which is faster, more secure, and reduces the risk of errors compared to paper filing. The IRS offers Free File for eligible taxpayers with incomes below a certain threshold, while commercial tax software provides guided support for more complex situations involving investments, self-employment, or rental properties. To file electronically, you\u2019ll need to input all your financial data, review the return for any discrepancies, and submit it directly to the tax authority. If you prefer paper filing, you\u2019ll need to complete the appropriate form (such as Form 1040 in the U.S.), attach all required schedules and documents, and mail it to the designated processing center. Be sure to note the filing deadline\u2014typically April 15 in the U.S.\u2014and request an extension if you need more time to avoid late-filing penalties.\n\n***\n\nOnce your return is submitted, you\u2019ll need to address any tax owed by the deadline to avoid interest and penalties. Payment options include online transfers via the IRS Direct Pay system, credit or debit card payments, or mailing a check or money order. If you can\u2019t pay the full amount upfront, you may qualify for an installment agreement or an offer in compromise to settle your debt for less than the total owed. In conclusion, filing and paying individual income taxes can be a straightforward process with proper preparation: organizing documents early, using reliable tools to calculate and file accurately, and exploring payment options if needed will help you meet your obligations efficiently and avoid unnecessary stress. By staying informed about changes to tax laws and leveraging available resources, you can ensure compliance while maximizing any potential refunds or credits you\u2019re entitled to."}

{"prompt": "Provide clear instructions on how to calculate the sum of two numbers. Explain the fundamental arithmetic principle behind this operation.\n\nYour response should contain exactly 4 paragraphs. Separate the paragraphs with ***.", "response": "To calculate the sum of two whole numbers, start by aligning their digits vertically according to their place values\u2014units with units, tens with tens, hundreds with hundreds, and so on. For example, when adding 27 and 15, write 27 above 15 so the 7 (units place of 27) lines up with 5 (units place of 15), and the 2 (tens place of 27) lines up with 1 (tens place of 15). Next, add the digits in the rightmost place value first: 7 + 5 = 12. Since this sum is 10 or more, write down the 2 in the units place of the result and carry over the 1 to the tens place. Then add the digits in the tens place, including the carried-over 1: 1 (carried) + 2 + 1 = 4. Write this 4 in the tens place of the result, giving a final sum of 42. For larger numbers, repeat this process from right to left, carrying over any value of 10 or more to the next higher place value each time.\n\n***\n\nThe fundamental arithmetic principle behind addition is the concept of place value, which is the backbone of our base-10 number system. Each digit in a number represents a multiple of a power of 10: the rightmost digit is 10\u2070 (units), the next is 10\u00b9 (tens), then 10\u00b2 (hundreds), and so on. When adding two numbers, we only combine digits that represent the same power of 10 because we are grouping equal quantities together. For instance, adding the units digits (7 and 5 in the example above) combines groups of 1, while adding the tens digits combines groups of 10. Carrying over a 1 to the next place value when a sum exceeds 9 is simply converting 10 units of one place value into 1 unit of the next higher place value, which aligns with how the base-10 system is structured.\n\n***\n\nThis process extends to other types of numbers with slight adjustments to maintain the principle of combining like quantities. For negative numbers, if both numbers are negative, add their absolute values and retain the negative sign (e.g., -3 + (-5) = -(3+5) = -8). If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value (e.g., 6 + (-2) = 4, since 6\u2019s absolute value is larger). For fractions, first find a common denominator to ensure you\u2019re adding equal parts: for 3/4 + 1/2, convert 1/2 to 2/4 so both fractions represent fourths, then add the numerators (3+2=5) to get 5/4. For decimals, align the decimal points to match place values (e.g., 1.23 + 4.5 becomes 1.23 + 4.50) before adding digit by digit as you would with whole numbers.\n\n***\n\nUnderstanding the link between the step-by-step process and the place value principle helps solidify your grasp of addition and prepares you for more advanced math. Even when adding algebraic terms, like 3x + 5x, you\u2019re applying the same core idea: combining like quantities (in this case, terms with the same variable raised to the same power). This foundational operation is not just a rote skill\u2014it\u2019s the building block for subtraction (which is inverse addition), multiplication (repeated addition), and complex calculations in fields like physics, engineering, and finance. By mastering how to combine like quantities correctly, you develop a robust framework for solving a wide range of mathematical problems with confidence."}

{"prompt": "Outline a step-by-step process for a complete beginner to learn how to master Python from scratch.\n\nYour response must finish with \"Follow the 5 steps listed above, and you will be successful.\" No other words should follow this.", "response": "Step 1: Set Up Your Environment and Learn Core Fundamentals\nFirst, install the latest version of Python from the official website and a beginner-friendly code editor like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the Python extension. Start with absolute basics: variables, data types (integers, strings, lists, dictionaries), basic arithmetic operations, print statements, and user input handling. Use free interactive platforms like Codecademy\u2019s Python course or the official Python Tutorial to learn these concepts. Practice daily by writing simple programs, such as a basic calculator, a name-greeter script, or a tool that counts characters in a string.\n\nStep 2: Master Control Flow and Functions\nNext, learn control flow structures: if-else statements, for loops, while loops, and break/continue keywords to direct program execution. Dive into functions: defining them, passing parameters, using return values, and working with default arguments. Explore lambda functions for short, anonymous operations and start leveraging Python\u2019s standard libraries (e.g., math for calculations, random for generating values). Practice with problems like a number guessing game, a script that filters odd numbers from a list, or a recursive factorial calculator.\n\nStep 3: Explore Intermediate Python Concepts\nMove to object-oriented programming (OOP): classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to write modular, reusable code. Master error handling with try-except blocks to make programs robust, and learn file I/O to read from and write to text or CSV files. Study advanced data structures like sets and tuples, and optimize code with list comprehensions and generator expressions. Build small projects here, such as a text-based adventure game, a simple inventory manager, or a script that organizes files by type.\n\nStep 4: Specialize in a Niche and Build Real-World Projects\nChoose a Python niche aligned with your interests: web development (Flask/Django), data science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), automation (Selenium, PyAutoGUI), or game development (Pygame). Learn relevant libraries and frameworks through targeted courses (e.g., Coursera\u2019s Python for Everybody or Udemy\u2019s Complete Python Bootcamp). Start with small projects: a personal blog with Flask, a sales data visualization tool with Matplotlib, or a form-filling automation script. Scale to complex projects like a weather app using an API or a to-do list with an SQLite database.\n\nStep 5: Refine Skills and Engage with the Python Community\nRefine code by following Python\u2019s PEP 8 style guide for clean, readable work, and master Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration. Solve algorithmic problems on LeetCode or HackerRank to boost problem-solving skills. Join communities: participate in Reddit\u2019s r/Python, ask questions on Stack Overflow, attend local meetups or virtual conferences. Contribute to open-source projects to gain real-world experience and learn from other developers. Regularly refactor old projects to apply new skills and optimize performance.\n\nFollow the 5 steps listed above, and you will be successful."}

{"prompt": "What kind of performance was the man giving on stage? What are the key elements that made his performance so captivating and engaging for the audience?\n\nYour response must contain at least 60 sentences, but less than 600 words.", "response": "The man on stage was delivering a spoken word poetry performance centered on small, everyday acts of kindness that often go unnoticed. From the moment he stepped under the warm spotlight, his presence commanded attention without being overbearing. He stood tall, his posture open and inviting, as if he was sharing a secret with each member of the audience individually. His voice was the first thing that hooked people\u2014rich and resonant, with subtle shifts in tone that matched every emotion in his words. When he spoke of a child sharing a cookie with a homeless man, his voice softened, almost to a whisper, making everyone lean in closer. When he described the joy of a neighbor watering plants while someone was away, his tone lifted, bright with warmth and sincerity. He didn\u2019t just recite lines; he lived them, his facial expressions mirroring the stories he told. A furrowed brow when he talked about how these small acts are often overlooked, a wide, genuine smile when he celebrated their impact. His hand gestures were deliberate, not excessive\u2014he\u2019d hold up one finger to emphasize a single, quiet moment, or spread his palms wide to encompass the audience, inviting them to recognize their own small kindnesses. Pacing was another key element; he knew exactly when to pause, letting a line hang in the air so the audience could absorb its meaning. After a line about how a single kind word can turn someone\u2019s day around, he paused for three full seconds, and you could hear a pin drop in the venue. That pause gave the audience time to reflect on their own experiences, making the performance personal rather than just a show. He also interacted with the audience in subtle ways, making eye contact with different people throughout the set. When he locked eyes with an older woman in the front row, she nodded slowly, clearly relating to his words. He even wove in a quick, off-the-cuff remark about the coffee shop down the street where baristas remember regulars\u2019 orders, making the performance feel rooted in their shared community. The theme itself was relatable; everyone has either given or received a small act of kindness, so his words struck a chord immediately. He didn\u2019t preach or lecture; he shared stories, making the message feel like a conversation rather than a speech. His vulnerability was captivating too; he opened up about a time he was struggling, and a stranger held the door for him, which helped him get through the day. That moment of honesty made the audience connect with him on a deeper level, seeing him as a real person rather than a performer. The way he built the performance was masterful, starting with small, individual stories and gradually expanding to how these acts weave together to form the fabric of a community. By the end, he was asking the audience to raise their hands if they\u2019d done a small kind act in the past week, and almost every hand went up. He thanked each person, his voice filled with gratitude, which made the audience feel seen and valued. The lighting also played a part, but it was his delivery that made it all work. He didn\u2019t rely on flashy props or background music; his words and presence were enough. Every element of his performance was focused on connection\u2014connecting the stories to the audience\u2019s lives, connecting with them emotionally, and connecting them to each other. When he finished, the audience didn\u2019t just clap; they cheered, some even wiped away tears. People were talking to each other afterward, sharing their own stories of small kindnesses, which showed how the performance had brought them together. His ability to make the universal feel personal was one of the most captivating parts. He didn\u2019t use complex language or fancy metaphors; his words were simple, clear, and heartfelt. That simplicity made his message accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or age. He also had a way of making even the most mundane moments feel special, like when he talked about a librarian reshelving books with care. He framed those moments as acts of love, not just chores, which made the audience see the beauty in their own everyday routines. His energy was consistent, never dipping too low or spiking too high, maintaining a steady, warm current that kept the audience engaged from start to finish. When he walked off stage, the applause lasted for minutes, and many people stayed behind to tell him how his performance had made them want to be more kind. It wasn\u2019t just a poetry set; it was a reminder of the power of human connection, delivered in a way that felt intimate, sincere, and deeply moving. The key to his captivation was that he didn\u2019t perform at the audience\u2014he performed with them, inviting them to be part of the story. He made them feel like they were co-creators of the message, not just spectators. His sincerity was palpable; you could tell he believed every word he said, which made it impossible not to believe him too. There was no pretense, no fake emotion\u2014just a man sharing stories that mattered to him, and in turn, they mattered to everyone in the room. Another thing: he avoided clich\u00e9s, instead using specific, vivid details that made his stories come alive. Instead of saying \u201ca kind gesture,\u201d he said \u201ca teenager leaving a sticky note with a positive message on a classmate\u2019s locker.\u201d Those specific details made the stories feel real, like they could have happened to anyone in the audience. He also addressed the audience directly, using \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cwe\u201d instead of just \u201cI,\u201d which made the message inclusive. For example, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all been there\u2014too busy to notice the small things, but when we do, they change everything.\u201d That inclusive language made everyone feel like they were part of a collective, not just individuals listening to a show. His timing was impeccable; he never rushed through a line, but he also didn\u2019t drag his feet, keeping the performance moving at a pace that held attention. When he transitioned from one story to the next, he did so smoothly, using a single line to bridge them, like \u201cAnd that\u2019s not the only time a small act made a big difference.\u201d This seamless transition kept the audience engaged, never letting their attention wander. He also used humor sparingly, but effectively\u2014when he talked about burning toast and a neighbor bringing over a plate of pancakes, he chuckled, and the audience laughed with him, breaking the tension and making the performance feel more relaxed. That humor balanced the more heartfelt moments, making the overall experience feel authentic and well-rounded. The fact that he didn\u2019t use any technology\u2014no slides, no music, no microphones (the venue was small enough that his voice carried naturally)\u2014meant all focus was on him and his words. There were no distractions, so the audience could fully immerse themselves in the stories he told. He also showed humility; at one point, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you how to be a better person. I\u2019m here to remind you that you already are, in the small ways that count.\u201d That humility made him relatable, not someone on a pedestal telling others what to do. The audience could see themselves in him, which made his message hit harder. By the end of the performance, many people felt inspired, not just entertained. They left with a renewed appreciation for the small, everyday moments that make life meaningful. His ability to combine emotional authenticity, deliberate pacing, relatable stories, and inclusive language made his performance truly captivating. It wasn\u2019t just a show\u2014it was an experience that stayed with the audience long after the final applause faded. In a world full of loud, flashy performances, his quiet, sincere set stood out because it connected people on a human level, reminding them of the power of kindness and community."}

educational experiences:\n- first-year core curriculum: focused on grounding contemporary art practice in critical theory and interdisciplinary experimentation. in critical theory in contemporary art, i wrote a 20-page analytical paper titled \u201cunraveling narratives: mixed-media as a tool for feminist resistance,\u201d which examined the work of 1970s feminist artists judy chicago and how their use of found materials and collaborative practice informed my own approach to centering marginalized voices. this paper was later published in the risd student art journal, \u201cstudio critique.\u201d in advanced mixed-media installation, i created \u201cborderlands: voices of the invisible,\u201d a 10-foot tall assemblage using reclaimed barn wood from providence\u2019s immigrant neighborhoods, LED light strips, and recorded oral histories of latinx farmworkers in rhode island. my mentor, prof. elijah moore, pushed me to refine the audio component, encouraging me to interweave the workers\u2019 stories with field recordings of the farms they labored on, creating a more immersive sensory experience. the installation was featured in risd\u2019s annual interdisciplinary art showcase, where it sparked conversations about labor rights and immigrant visibility with local community members.\n- second-year: served as a teaching assistant for undergraduate foundational drawing and mixed-media basics courses. i developed lesson plans that emphasized accessibility, teaching students to use found materials (cardboard, old magazines, discarded fabric) instead of expensive art supplies, which aligned with my commitment to demystifying art-making for non-traditional learners. i also participated in a 6-month residency at the risd museum, where i had exclusive access to the museum\u2019s collection of west african kente cloth and yoruba beadwork. this research informed my series \u201cencoded resistance,\u201d which combined hand-woven textile patterns (inspired by kente cloth) with digital projections of 2020 black lives matter protest footage. i presented this series at the risd museum\u2019s emerging artist showcase, where it was featured in the providence journal\u2019s arts section. additionally, i attended a 2-week workshop with visiting artist wangechi mutu, who taught me about integrating ceramic sculpture with mixed-media assemblage. this workshop inspired me to create a series of ceramic vessels embedded with handwritten notes from immigrant youth, which later became a core component of my graduate thesis.\n- third-year: completed my graduate thesis, \u201cwe carry the maps: intergenerational memory in mixed media,\u201d a multi-part exhibition held at risd\u2019s woods-gerry gallery. the exhibition included three components: 1) a series of 8 large-scale tapestries woven from reclaimed fabric (old clothing from my family and local immigrant communities) and embedded with QR codes that linked to audio interviews of my grandmother discussing her journey from oaxaca, mexico, to the u.s. in 1985; 2) a collection of 15 ceramic vessels, each containing a handwritten letter from a local immigrant youth, displayed in a dark room with soft, warm lighting to encourage intimate engagement; and 3) a site-specific video projection on the gallery\u2019s exterior wall, which showed footage of immigrant families gathering for community meals, overlaid with text from the youth\u2019s letters. the thesis was selected as the recipient of the risd graduate thesis prize for social practice art, and i was invited to present a talk about the project at the national women\u2019s art conference in boston in 2023. during this year, i also presented a paper titled \u201cfound objects as archival evidence\u201d at the college art association\u2019s annual conference in chicago, where i discussed how using discarded materials in my work helps preserve marginalized histories that are often excluded from traditional archives.\n\nuniversity of oregon, school of art + design, eugene, or\nbachelor of fine arts in mixed-media art | 2016\u20132020\ngpa: 3.8/4.0 | recipient of outstanding undergraduate thesis award, study abroad merit scholarship, haystack mountain school residency fellowship\n\nkey educational experiences:\n- freshman year: built a strong foundation in traditional and experimental art practices. in drawing from observation, i completed a 12-week project titled \u201cforgotten landscapes,\u201d where i documented abandoned industrial sites in portland, oregon, using charcoal sketches and digital photography. prof. lila rodriguez, my drawing instructor, introduced me to mixed-media by challenging me to combine my charcoal sketches with found object assemblage\u2014for example, attaching rusted nails and broken glass from the industrial sites to my drawings to add texture and depth. this project taught me to see found materials not as waste, but as carriers of history and narrative. in color theory, i created a site-specific installation in the campus courtyard titled \u201ccolor in transition,\u201d which used large sheets of colored plastic and LED lights to explore how light changes the perception of color throughout the day. this installation was selected for the university\u2019s annual freshman art showcase, where it was praised for its interactive, site-responsive design.\n- sophomore year: expanded my skills in printmaking and mixed-media collage through advanced courses and a study abroad program. in experimental printmaking, i learned intaglio, screen printing, and digital collage, and created a series of prints titled \u201curban fragments\u201d that combined screen-printed images of portland\u2019s skyline with digital collages of immigrant-owned businesses. i also participated in a 3-day workshop with visiting artist juan carlos rivera, who taught me to use recycled materials (old newspapers, cardboard boxes) in printmaking, which inspired me to shift my practice toward using sustainable, reclaimed materials exclusively. in the spring, i studied abroad at escola massana in barcelona, spain, where i took courses in ceramic sculpture and street art intervention. in ceramic sculpture, i created a series of small, hand-built vessels that explored the theme of home, using clay sourced from barcelona\u2019s coastal regions. in street art intervention, i collaborated with local artists to create a site-specific mural in the el raval neighborhood, which addressed gentrification by depicting local residents and small business owners alongside images of the neighborhood\u2019s changing landscape. the mural was featured in barcelona\u2019s local art magazine, \u201cartes de barcelona,\u201d and was later used as a teaching tool in escola massana\u2019s community art courses.\n- junior year: focused on community-engaged art through courses and independent study. in art and social justice, i collaborated with portland youth build, a non-profit that supports homeless youth, to create a series of mixed-media portraits titled \u201cvoices unheard.\u201d each portrait combined charcoal sketches of the youth with found objects they collected (old clothing scraps, broken headphones, handwritten notes) to represent their personal stories of displacement. the series was exhibited at the portland art museum\u2019s emerging artist gallery, where it raised $2,000 for portland youth build through print sales. i also completed an independent study with prof. marcus thompson, where i explored the intersection of text and image. i created a series of 5 artist books titled \u201cfractured lines,\u201d which combined handwritten poetry about my mother\u2019s experience as an immigrant farmworker with monoprints of the oregon farms she worked on. these books were later included in the university of oregon\u2019s special collections library, where they are used as educational resources for courses in chicano studies and art history.\n- senior year: completed my undergraduate capstone project, \u201cfractured narratives: mapping displacement in the pacific northwest.\u201d this large-scale installation combined video projections, found object sculptures, and interactive sound elements to tell the stories of indigenous communities in oregon displaced by dam construction. i spent 6 months interviewing members of the confederated tribes of warm springs and the umatilla indian reservation, recording their stories of losing their ancestral lands. i then translated these stories into visual elements: video projections of the flooded lands, sculptures made from reclaimed wood from the dam sites, and sound installations that combined the tribes\u2019 traditional songs with field recordings of the rivers. the capstone was selected for the university\u2019s annual senior thesis exhibition, and i won the school of art + design\u2019s outstanding undergraduate thesis award. in the summer before graduation, i attended a 4-week residency at the haystack mountain school of crafts in maine, where i learned glassblowing and integrated this skill into my mixed-media practice, creating a series of glass sculptures that represented the \u201cfractured\u201d landscapes of the displaced communities.\n\nrelevant coursework:\nrisd

{"prompt": "Provide an alternative method that is more effective and safe for the chain. Make sure to include any necessary tools or materials in your instructions, and mention any precautions to take during the process.\n\nYour response must contain at least 20 sentences. More than 4 words in your response should be in all capital letters.", "response": "If you\u2019re looking for a more effective and safe alternative to traditional chain maintenance methods (like manual scrubbing with harsh solvents or over-spraying lubricants), the CLOSED-LOOP ULTRASONIC CLEANING AND PRECISION LUBRICATION PROCESS is the gold standard for industrial, agricultural, and heavy-duty chains. This method eliminates the risks of worker exposure to toxic chemicals, reduces environmental waste, and ensures a deeper, more thorough clean that extends the chain\u2019s lifespan by 30-40% compared to conventional practices. Before starting, gather all necessary tools and materials, which include an INDUSTRIAL ULTRASONIC CLEANING TANK with temperature control and a built-in filtration system, a BIODEGRADABLE, NON-TOXIC ULTRASONIC CLEANING SOLUTION (pH-neutral, no harsh solvents), a HIGH-PRESSURE, LOW-VOLUME (HPLV) LUBRICATION SYSTEM with a precision nozzle attachment, a MAGNETIC PARTICLE INSPECTION (MPI) KIT for post-cleaning damage assessment, non-abrasive microfiber cloths, and essential PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) such as NITRILE GLOVES, SAFETY GOGGLES, EAR PLUGS, and a DISPOSABLE RESPIRATOR. You\u2019ll also need a chain tension gauge to ensure proper tension post-maintenance and a waterproof mat to protect the work area from slips and contamination.\n\nFirst, prepare your work space by clearing a well-ventilated area away from moving machinery, and lay down the waterproof mat to catch any residual solution or lubricant. Never perform maintenance on a chain that\u2019s still attached to powered equipment\u2014always use lockout/tagout (LOTO) procedures to disconnect the chain safely, as accidental startup can lead to severe entanglement or crushing injuries. Next, conduct a preliminary inspection using the MAGNETIC PARTICLE INSPECTION (MPI) KIT to identify any hidden cracks, corrosion, or worn links; mark these areas with a non-toxic paint pen so you can revisit them after cleaning, as dirt and grime often mask underlying damage that could cause chain failure.\n\nSet up the ultrasonic cleaning tank by filling it with the biodegradable cleaning solution, following the manufacturer\u2019s dilution instructions (typically 10-15% solution to water), and set the temperature to 40-50\u00b0C. This temperature range optimizes the solution\u2019s cleaning power without damaging the chain\u2019s metal or protective coatings, and the built-in filtration system will capture dislodged dirt, grease, and metal shavings to prevent recontamination. Lower the chain into the tank using a non-metallic hanger to avoid scratching the chain or interfering with ultrasonic waves, and let it soak for 10-15 minutes. The ultrasonic waves create tiny, high-energy bubbles that implode, dislodging dirt from even the tightest crevices between links, pins, and rollers\u2014something manual scrubbing can never fully achieve. Avoid leaving the chain in the tank for longer than 20 minutes, as prolonged exposure could cause minor corrosion on uncoated metal surfaces.\n\nOnce the ultrasonic cycle is complete, remove the chain and rinse it thoroughly with warm, clean water to remove any residual cleaning solution. Pat it dry with non-abrasive microfiber cloths, making sure to reach every link and roller, and use a low-pressure air blower (set to no more than 20 PSI) to blow out excess moisture from hard-to-reach areas\u2014never use high-pressure air, as this can damage delicate seals or push debris deeper into the chain\u2019s components. Now, repeat the MAGNETIC PARTICLE INSPECTION (MPI) to get a clear view of the chain\u2019s condition; if you find any damaged components (like cracked links or worn pins), replace them immediately, as attempting to repair these issues will only lead to catastrophic failure during operation.\n\nNext, move on to precision lubrication with the HPLV system. Attach the precision nozzle to the system, load it with a high-quality, biodegradable chain lubricant formulated for your chain\u2019s specific material (e.g., steel, stainless steel, or coated chain), and set the system to deliver a low-volume, high-pressure spray directly onto the chain\u2019s pins and rollers. Avoid spraying the outer side plates, as excess lubricant here will attract dirt and grime, undoing your cleaning efforts. Move the nozzle slowly along the length of the chain to ensure each pin receives a thin, uniform coating\u2014this method uses 70% less lubricant than traditional spray cans, reducing waste and environmental impact.\n\nAfter lubrication, wipe away any excess lubricant from the outer plates with a microfiber cloth, and use the chain tension gauge to check that the chain meets the manufacturer\u2019s tension specifications. Adjust the tension if necessary, as improper tension can cause excessive wear or chain slippage during operation. Reconnect the chain to its operating system only after you\u2019ve confirmed all components are in good condition and lubrication is complete, then run the chain at a slow speed for 5-10 minutes to allow the lubricant to distribute evenly across all moving parts.\n\nThroughout the entire process, it\u2019s critical to follow key precautions to ensure safety and effectiveness. Always wear the required PPE: NITRILE GLOVES protect your hands from the cleaning solution and lubricant, SAFETY GOGGLES prevent splashes from getting into your eyes, EAR PLUGS reduce exposure to ultrasonic noise (which can exceed 85 dB and cause hearing damage), and the DISPOSABLE RESPIRATOR guards against minor mist from the cleaning tank. Never use harsh, solvent-based cleaning solutions, as these can damage the chain\u2019s protective coatings, release toxic fumes, and harm the environment\u2014stick to the biodegradable, pH-neutral solution to meet OSHA and EPA standards. Do not overload the ultrasonic tank, as overcrowding reduces cleaning effectiveness; follow the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines for maximum load capacity. Regularly maintain the tank\u2019s filtration system by cleaning or replacing filters every 5-10 cycles, as clogged filters will lead to recontamination of the chain. When using the HPLV system, point the nozzle away from yourself and other workers to avoid minor skin irritation from the high-pressure spray. Finally, if you find significant damage during the MPI inspection, do not reuse the chain\u2014replace it with a new one that meets the manufacturer\u2019s specifications to avoid costly downtime or safety incidents. This closed-loop process is not only safer for workers and the environment but also ensures that your chain operates at peak performance for years to come."}
{"prompt": "If you are a computer science professional who enjoys solving riddles and puzzles, try to decipher the logic behind the sorting program described in the blog post.\n\nYour entire reply should contain 600 to 700 words.", "response": "As a computer science professional with a penchant for riddles, I was immediately hooked when I stumbled on a blog post titled \u201cThe EnigmaSort: Can You Crack Its Logic?\u201d The post included a pseudocode snippet for a sorting algorithm that claimed to sort any array of ordered elements without using obvious operations like swapping, partitioning, or recursive splitting. My first step was to dissect the code line by line to uncover its hidden logic.\n\nThe pseudocode read:\n```\nFunction EnigmaSort(arr):\n    n = length(arr)\n    result = new array of size n\n    for i from 0 to n-1:\n        count = 0\n        for j from 0 to n-1:\n            if arr[j] < arr[i] or (arr[j] == arr[i] and j < i):\n                count += 1\n        result[count] = arr[i]\n    return result\n```\n\nFirst, I noted the nested loops, which hinted at an O(n\u00b2) time complexity\u2014ruling out efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms like quicksort or merge sort. The key to cracking the riddle lay in the inner loop\u2019s condition, which seemed arbitrary at first glance. To unpack it, I tested the algorithm on a small example from the blog: the array [3, 1, 4, 1, 5].\n\nFor the first element, 3 (index 0), the inner loop counted elements where arr[j] < 3 (the two 1s at indices 1 and 3) or where arr[j] ==3 and j <0 (which was impossible). The count was 2, so 3 was placed at index 2 in the result. Next, the second element (1 at index1): no elements were smaller than 1, and no j <1 had a value of 1, so count was 0. The 1 went to index0. \n\nThe fourth element (another1 at index3) was where the riddle started to make sense. The inner loop counted j=1 (a 1 with j <3), so count was1. This 1 was placed at index1, right after the first1. Ah\u2014this clause ensured that duplicates retained their original relative order, meaning EnigmaSort is a stable sort. \n\nFor the 4 at index2, the count was3 (the two1s and the3), so it went to index3. Finally, the5 at index4 had a count of4 (all other elements were smaller), so it landed at index4. The result was [1,1,3,4,5]\u2014perfectly sorted, with duplicates in their original order.\n\nI then generalized this logic: the count variable for each element arr[i] is its exact rank in the original array. The rank is defined as the number of elements that should appear before arr[i] in the sorted output. For unique elements, this is simply the number of elements smaller than arr[i]. For duplicates, the \u201cj <i\u201d clause adds 1 for every duplicate that appeared earlier, ensuring each duplicate is placed immediately after the previous one. \n\nThis realization connected EnigmaSort to a lesser-known variant of counting sort, but with a critical difference. Standard counting sort uses a frequency array to tally occurrences of each value, which is O(n + k) time where k is the range of input values. EnigmaSort, by contrast, calculates ranks via pairwise comparisons, eliminating the need to know the input range upfront. This makes it flexible for any ordered data type (strings, floats, custom objects) as long as a less-than operator is defined, albeit at the cost of higher time complexity.\n\nTesting edge cases confirmed my hypothesis: an empty array returned empty, a reverse-sorted array [5,4,3,2,1] was correctly sorted to [1,2,3,4,5], and an array of all duplicates [2,2,2] retained its order (though sorted order is identical). \n\nIn the end, EnigmaSort\u2019s \u201cenigma\u201d was its clever rephrasing of rank-based sorting. Instead of using frequency tables or partitioning, it leverages pairwise comparisons to directly compute each element\u2019s correct position. While not efficient for large datasets, it\u2019s a brilliant riddle that highlights the core idea behind sorting: assigning each element to its rightful place based on its relative order to others. The blog post\u2019s author had masked a fundamental sorting concept in a seemingly convoluted loop, turning a basic algorithm into an engaging puzzle for CS enthusiasts."}

This means aligning keywords skills and experiences directly with what the employer lists as required or preferred. Failing to tailor can lead to your resume being overlooked by applicant tracking systems or hiring managers.\n\n1. Contact Information\nKey points: Full name Professional phone number Professional email address (avoid casual handles like partygirl123) Location (city and state only no full street address) Optional professional social media link (like LinkedIn with an updated profile) Optional portfolio link if relevant to the job (for designers writers developers etc)\n\n2. Professional Summary or Objective\nKey points: For experienced candidates Professional Summary 2 to 3 lines highlighting years of relevant experience core key skills and 1 to 2 major achievements aligned with the job requirements. For entry level candidates Career Objective 2 to 3 lines stating career goals relevant skills and how you can add value to the specific company. Tailor this section by using exact keywords from the job posting (e.g if the job says \"agile project management\" include that phrase if you have experience)\n\n3. Professional Experience\nKey points: Reverse chronological order (most recent job first) For each role include Job title Company name Location Employment dates (month and year) 3 to 5 bullet points describing achievements not just duties. Use action verbs (led implemented optimized etc) and quantify results where possible (e.g \"Increased customer retention by 20 percent over 6 months\" instead of \"Worked on customer retention\") Tailor each bullet point to match the job\u2019s required skills. For example if the job prioritizes cross functional collaboration include a bullet about leading cross team projects to meet company goals. Omit irrelevant roles or duties that do not connect to the target job.\n\n4. Education\nKey points: Reverse chronological order Degree earned (e.g Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) Institution name Location Graduation date (month and year or just year if graduated more than 5 years ago) Relevant coursework (optional for entry level candidates or if coursework directly ties to the job e.g \"Relevant Coursework: Data Analysis Machine Learning\" for a data science role) Academic honors (optional e.g magna cum laude Dean\u2019s List)\n\n5.

Additional Sections (Optional Tailored to Job)\nKey points: Certifications (e.g PMP Google Analytics Certified) if the job values them Projects (personal or professional e.g \"Developed a mobile app to track fitness goals\" for a software engineering role) Volunteer Experience (if it demonstrates relevant skills e.g \"Volunteered as event coordinator for local non profit\" for a project management job) Languages (if the job requires bilingual skills e.g \"Fluent in Spanish and English\") Publications (for academic or research focused roles)\n\n### Critical Tailoring Reminder\nThe most important step in resume creation is tailoring. Before writing review the job description thoroughly. Highlight all required and preferred skills experiences and qualifications. Then map every section of your resume to these points. Use the same terminology as the job posting to pass applicant tracking system filters and show the hiring manager that you are a perfect fit for the role. Generic resumes are easy to spot and often discarded quickly. Taking the time to tailor each resume to the specific job increases your chances of getting an interview significantly."}
{"prompt": "Provide a step-by-step guide on how to potty train a puppy using positive reinforcement techniques.\n\nYour response must end with \"Which one you choose?\".", "response": "### Step-by-Step Guide to Potty Training a Puppy with Positive Reinforcement\n\n1. **Establish a Consistent Daily Routine**  \nPuppies have small bladders and rely on predictability to learn. Schedule potty breaks at key times: immediately after waking up, 15\u201330 minutes after eating/drinking, after play sessions, and right before bedtime. For puppies under 4 months, plan breaks every 1\u20132 hours during the day to prevent accidents.\n\n2. **Designate a Fixed Potty Spot**  \nPick one specific outdoor area for your puppy to use. Take them to this spot on a leash every time\u2014this helps them link the location to pottying. If your puppy has already used the spot, leave a small amount of their previous waste (if allowed) to reinforce the scent cue, which encourages them to return.\n\n3. **Supervise Closely Indoors**  \nKeep your puppy within your line of sight when they\u2019re not in their crate. Watch for early signs of needing to potty: sniffing the floor, circling, pacing, or whining. If you notice these cues, immediately guide them to their designated potty spot. Use a properly sized crate (big enough to stand, turn around, and lie down) as a safe space\u2014puppies avoid soiling their sleeping area, so this reduces accidents.\n\n4. **Reward Good Behavior Instantly**  \nAs soon as your puppy finishes pottying in the correct spot, give them a high-value treat (something they don\u2019t get daily), enthusiastic verbal praise (e.g., \u201cWow, you\u2019re such a good pup!\u201d), and a quick gentle pet or play session. Timing is critical\u2014deliver the reward within 2 seconds so your puppy connects the behavior to the positive outcome.\n\n5. **Handle Accidents Calmly**  \nIf you catch your puppy in the middle of an indoor accident, gently say \u201cuh-oh\u201d to interrupt them, then quickly take them to their potty spot. Never scold, yell, or punish your puppy\u2014this can make them afraid to potty in front of you or cause anxiety. Clean up accidents with an enzymatic cleaner (avoid ammonia-based products, which smell like urine to dogs) to remove all traces of scent.\n\n6. **Gradually Increase Indoor Freedom**  \nOnce your puppy has 3\u20135 consecutive days of no accidents, start giving them access to one additional room at a time. Continue supervising closely and rewarding good behavior. If an accident happens, scale back their freedom temporarily and return to more frequent potty breaks.\n\n7. **Introduce Verbal Cues**  \nAfter a week of consistent pottying in the right spot, add a verbal cue like \u201cGo potty\u201d while your puppy is in the act. Over time, they\u2019ll learn to associate the cue with the behavior, allowing you to prompt them to go when needed (e.g., before a car ride).\n\n8. **Master Nighttime Training**  \nTake your puppy to their potty spot right before bedtime. For young puppies, set an alarm to wake up once or twice nightly (every 3\u20134 hours) to take them out. Keep nighttime trips calm and business-like\u2014no playtime\u2014so your puppy knows it\u2019s time to potty and return to sleep. Reward them if they go in the correct spot.\n\nWhich one you choose?"}
{"prompt": "Describe the importance of understanding underlying truths, without using metaphors or analogies, and without mentioning curiosity or questioning things.\n\nYour response should contain stress words which are capitalized, but limit those capitalized stress words to less than 20 times.", "response": "Understanding underlying truths is critical for building SUSTAINABLE outcomes across all areas of life. In personal health, it ensures choices are based on FUNDAMENTAL facts about how the body functions, rather than fleeting trends. This leads to LASTING well-being instead of temporary fixes that cause more harm than good.\n\nIn professional environments, grasping these truths enables EFFECTIVE planning and resource allocation. For instance, recognizing the real limits of team capacity prevents BURNOUT and ensures work meets consistent, RELIABLE standards. Without this awareness, decisions risk wasting time, money, and talent on initiatives that cannot deliver on their promises.\n\nIn societal contexts, understanding underlying truths is essential for creating policies that address ROOT causes of inequity, not just visible symptoms. This approach reduces recurring injustices and builds more INCLUSIVE systems that serve all members of a community.\n\nIn personal relationships, knowing the underlying truths about another person\u2019s needs fosters GENUINE trust and connection. It allows for responses that resolve core issues, rather than just managing surface-level conflicts that would otherwise persist.\n\nOverall, ignoring underlying truths leads to PREVENTABLE mistakes, wasted effort, and outcomes that fail to stand the test of time. Prioritizing this understanding ensures actions are intentional, purposeful, and aligned with what is actually true, rather than what appears to be true on the surface."}
{"prompt": "Outline the key events and milestones in the Internet's history.\n\nYour response should be at least 50 sentences long.", "response": "The history of the internet is a story of Cold War paranoia, academic innovation, commercial expansion, and global connectivity, spanning decades of technological breakthroughs that transformed every aspect of human life. It all began in the late 1950s, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957. This event sent shockwaves through the United States, which feared falling behind in technological and military prowess. In response, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958, tasked with developing cutting-edge technologies to maintain national security. One of ARPA\u2019s key goals was to create a communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack\u2014unlike traditional centralized networks, which would collapse if a single hub was destroyed, this new network would be decentralized, with no single point of failure.\n\nIn 1962, computer scientist J.C.R. Licklider, who worked at ARPA, published a memo titled \u201cIntergalactic Computer Network,\u201d in which he envisioned a global network of interconnected computers that would allow users to access data and communicate with one another from anywhere in the world. This memo laid the conceptual foundation for what would become the internet. Over the next few years, ARPA funded research into packet switching, a technology that breaks data into small \u201cpackets\u201d to send across a network, reassembling them at the destination. Packet switching was crucial because it allowed multiple users to share the same network resources efficiently, a stark contrast to the circuit-switching technology used in traditional telephone networks.\n\nThe first major test of this packet-switching network came in 1969, when ARPANET\u2014ARPA\u2019s experimental network\u2014connected its first four nodes: the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University of Utah. On October 29, 1969, researchers at UCLA attempted to send the first message to SRI: the word \u201cLOGIN.\u201d Unfortunately, the system crashed after sending the first two letters, \u201cLO,\u201d but this small success marked the birth of the first wide-area packet-switching network. Over the next few years, ARPANET expanded to include more universities and research institutions across the United States, allowing scientists to share data and collaborate remotely.\n\nThe 1970s brought critical advancements that turned ARPANET into a true \u201cinternet\u201d\u2014a network of networks. In 1971, computer engineer Ray Tomlinson, working on ARPANET, invented email as a way for users on different nodes to communicate. He chose the @ symbol to separate the user\u2019s name from the host computer, a convention that remains in use today. Email quickly became the most popular application on ARPANET, demonstrating the internet\u2019s potential for personal communication beyond academic research.\n\nIn 1974, computer scientists Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn published a groundbreaking paper titled \u201cA Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication,\u201d which outlined the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP). TCP/IP is a set of rules that standardizes how data is broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, and reassembled across different networks. Before TCP/IP, each network used its own proprietary protocol, making it impossible for them to communicate with one another. Cerf and Kahn\u2019s solution created a universal language for network communication, which is often called the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the internet.\n\nIn 1977, Cerf led the first successful test of TCP/IP across three distinct networks: ARPANET, the Packet Radio Network (a wireless network for military use), and the Packet Satellite Network (a satellite-based network connecting the U.S. to Europe). This test proved that TCP/IP could seamlessly connect different types of networks, marking the first time multiple networks operated as a single, interconnected system\u2014this is widely considered the first iteration of the internet as we know it.\n\nThe 1980s saw the internet expand beyond military and academic circles and begin to take shape as a more accessible tool. In 1983, ARPANET made the full switch to TCP/IP as its primary communication protocol, abandoning the older Network Control Program (NCP). This date\u2014January 1, 1983\u2014is often cited as the official \u201cbirthday\u201d of the internet, as it was the first time all nodes on ARPANET used the standardized TCP/IP protocol, enabling easy communication with other networks.\n\nLater that decade, in 1984, the Domain Name System (DNS) was introduced to solve a growing problem: as more computers joined the internet, remembering numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) became increasingly difficult for users. DNS replaced these numbers with human-readable domain names, such as .edu for educational institutions, .gov for government agencies, and .com for commercial entities. The first domain name registered was symbolics.com in 1985, and DNS made the internet far more user-friendly, paving the way for broader adoption.\n\nIn 1985, the first commercial internet service provider (ISP) in the United States, The World, launched in Boston, Massachusetts. For a monthly fee, users could dial into the internet using a modem, accessing email and other network services. This marked the beginning of commercialization, as the internet started to move beyond government and academic funding into the private sector.\n\nThe late 1980s also saw the birth of a technology that would make the internet a household name: the World Wide Web. In 1989, British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), proposed a system of hypertext documents linked together over the internet. Berners-Lee\u2019s goal was to create a way for scientists at CERN and around the world to share research papers and data easily. Unlike the internet itself, which is a network of networks, the World Wide Web is a collection of interconnected documents and resources accessed via hyperlinks\u2014an important distinction that many people still confuse today.\n\nThe 1990s were a decade of explosive growth, as the internet moved from a niche academic tool to a mainstream global phenomenon. In 1990, ARPANET was officially decommissioned, having served its purpose as a research network. That same year, Berners-Lee launched the first website, which provided information about the World Wide Web, and created the first web browser, called WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the web itself). This browser allowed users to view and edit hypertext documents, laying the groundwork for the web\u2019s expansion.\n\nIn 1993, a team of students and researchers at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois released Mosaic, the first widely used graphical web browser. Before Mosaic, web browsers were text-based, requiring users to type commands to navigate. Mosaic\u2019s intuitive interface, which included images and clickable links, made web browsing accessible to non-technical users for the first time. Its popularity skyrocketed, with millions of downloads in its first year, and it is often credited with sparking the \u201cweb revolution.\u201d\n\nMosaic\u2019s success inspired the creation of Netscape Navigator, launched in 1994 by former NCSA employees. Netscape quickly became the dominant web browser, capturing over 90% of the market share by 1995. Its popularity coincided with the rise of commercial websites: in 1994, Amazon.com was founded as an online bookstore, and Yahoo! launched as a web directory, helping users find content amid the growing number of websites.\n\n1995 was a pivotal year for the internet\u2019s mainstream adoption. eBay, the first major online auction site, launched in September, creating a new platform for peer-to-peer commerce. Microsoft released Windows 95, the first version of its operating system to include built-in support for internet connectivity. This meant that millions of home computer users could access the internet without installing additional software, making it easier than ever to get online. By the end of 1995, there were over 10 million internet users worldwide, up from just 1 million in 1993.\n\nThe mid-1990s also saw the rise of the \u201cdot-com bubble,\u201d a period of speculative investment in internet-based companies. Investors poured billions of dollars into startups with little more than a website and a catchy name, believing that the internet would revolutionize every industry. Companies like Pets.com and Webvan became household names, but many were not profitable and relied on continuous investment to stay afloat. The bubble burst in 2000, when stock prices for dot-com companies collapsed, leading to the failure of hundreds of startups. However, established companies like Amazon and Google, which had solid business models, survived and went on to become some of the most valuable companies in the world.\n\nIn 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two graduate students at Stanford University, founded Google. Their search engine used a revolutionary algorithm called PageRank, which ranked websites based on the number and quality of links pointing to them. Unlike earlier search engines, which often returned irrelevant results, Google provided accurate, useful information quickly, making it the go-to search tool for millions of users. That same year, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) was established to manage the global Domain Name System, ensuring that internet governance was decentralized and inclusive of stakeholders from around the world.\n\nThe late 1990s also saw the rise of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing, with the launch of Napster in 1999."}

{"prompt": "Please answer the following question based on the previous context: What caused the cold climate in the Arctic?\n\nYour response must not contain the words 'yes' or 'no'.", "response": "The cold climate in the Arctic arises from several interconnected factors. First, its high polar latitude means the sun\u2019s rays strike the region at an extremely shallow angle, dispersing solar energy over a broad area and reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the land, water, and atmosphere. Second, the extensive snow and ice cover across the Arctic has a high albedo, reflecting most incoming sunlight back into space rather than converting it into heat, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that sustains low temperatures. Additionally, the persistent sea ice layer insulates the cold Arctic Ocean from the atmosphere, preventing warmer ocean waters from transferring heat to the air above. The polar vortex, a large-scale circular wind pattern in the upper atmosphere, also contributes by trapping cold air masses over the region, limiting their mixing with warmer air from lower latitudes."}

{"prompt": "Provide a recipe that uses poppy seeds, and explain the benefits of including them in the dish.\n\nYour answer should have exactly 7 paragraphs. The last paragraph must start with the word \"Summary\". Each paragraph should be separated by two new lines.", "response": "If you\u2019re looking for a bright, moist baked good that sneaks in nutritional perks, a Lemon-Poppy Seed Yogurt Cake is the perfect choice. This dish balances the zing of fresh lemon with the subtle, nutty crunch of poppy seeds, creating a treat ideal for breakfast, afternoon tea, or a light dessert. Poppy seeds aren\u2019t just a decorative addition here\u2014they play a key role in elevating the cake\u2019s texture and flavor, while also packing a punch of essential nutrients that make this indulgence feel a little more wholesome.\n\n\nTo make this cake, gather the following ingredients: 1 \u00bd cups all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour blend for a GF version), 1 tsp baking powder, \u00bd tsp baking soda, \u00bc tsp salt, \u00be cup granulated sugar, 2 large eggs (or 2 flax eggs for vegan), 1 cup plain Greek yogurt (or plant-based yogurt), \u00bc cup neutral oil (like canola or olive oil), 2 tbsp fresh lemon zest, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 3 tbsp poppy seeds. For an optional finishing touch, mix 1 cup powdered sugar with 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice to create a tangy glaze.\n\n\nStart by preheating your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C) and greasing a 9-inch round cake pan or loaf pan. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until smooth, then stir in the yogurt, oil, lemon zest, and vanilla extract. Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry mixture, stirring until just combined\u2014avoid overmixing to keep the cake moist. Fold in the poppy seeds, then pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool completely before drizzling with the lemon glaze, if using.\n\n\nBeyond their flavor and texture, poppy seeds offer impressive nutritional benefits that make this cake a smarter choice than many standard baked goods. They are an excellent source of dietary fiber, with just one tablespoon providing about 1.5 grams of fiber\u2014enough to support healthy digestion, promote feelings of fullness, and help regulate blood sugar levels. Poppy seeds also contain essential minerals: calcium for strong bones and teeth, iron to support red blood cell production, and magnesium which aids in muscle and nerve function. For a breakfast treat, this means you\u2019re starting your day with a dose of nutrients that fuel your body long after the first bite.\n\n\nPoppy seeds also enhance the cake\u2019s sensory appeal in ways that few other ingredients can. Their tiny, hard seeds add a subtle, satisfying crunch that contrasts beautifully with the soft, moist crumb of the yogurt cake. Flavor-wise, they bring a mild, nutty, slightly earthy note that balances the bright, tart lemon zest, preventing the cake from tasting overly sweet or acidic. This complementary pairing makes each bite feel layered and intentional, turning a simple yogurt cake into a more complex, enjoyable experience without overwhelming the palate.\n\n\nAnother key benefit of including poppy seeds in this dish is their versatility and dietary friendliness. Poppy seeds are naturally gluten-free, so when paired with a gluten-free flour blend, this cake becomes a safe and delicious option for those following a gluten-free diet. They are also vegan-friendly, making them easy to incorporate into plant-based versions of the cake by swapping eggs and yogurt for vegan alternatives. Additionally, poppy seeds have a long shelf life when stored in an airtight container, so you can keep them on hand to add quick texture and nutrition to everything from muffins to salad dressings or even savory dishes like roasted vegetables.\n\n\nSummary: The Lemon-Poppy Seed Yogurt Cake is a delightful way to enjoy the many benefits of poppy seeds, combining great taste with nutritional value, textural depth, and dietary flexibility. This recipe is simple to make, requires common ingredients, and yields a cake that\u2019s perfect for any occasion. Poppy seeds not only boost the cake\u2019s fiber and mineral content but also add a subtle crunch and nutty flavor that balances the bright lemon, making each bite more satisfying. Whether you\u2019re looking for a nutrient-packed breakfast or a light dessert, this dish proves that poppy seeds are far more than just a decorative garnish\u2014they\u2019re a valuable ingredient that elevates both the taste and health profile of your food."}
{"prompt": "If the blog post you wrote about the sleek new magistrates receives positive feedback from readers, provide additional details on the specific technologies and innovations they have implemented in their courtrooms, while ensuring that the description is understandable to readers without prior legal or technical knowledge.\n\nYour response must be at least 300 words long. It should contain exactly 3 bullet points (that are marked by an asterisk, *). Your response should have a postscript starting with P.S. at the end.", "response": "Thanks to all of you for the overwhelmingly positive feedback on last week\u2019s post about the sleek new magistrates\u2019 courtrooms rolling out across the region! So many of you commented on how refreshing it is to see legal systems embracing innovation to make justice more accessible and efficient\u2014and you asked for deeper dives into the specific technologies making this possible. I\u2019m happy to share the details, broken down in plain language so anyone can follow along:\n\n* AI-powered real-time transcription and multilingual support: Gone are the days of court scribes furiously typing every word, with transcripts taking days or weeks to process. Each courtroom now uses an advanced AI tool that listens to every spoken word during hearings and converts it into a fully formatted transcript in real time. But it doesn\u2019t stop there\u2014this system also offers instant translation into over 20 languages, displayed as subtitles on screens for witnesses, defendants, and even members of the public in attendance. For example, a Spanish-speaking defendant who might have previously relied on a delayed or overstretched interpreter can now follow every question and response as it happens, ensuring they fully understand the proceedings and can participate meaningfully. After the hearing, the transcript is automatically shared with all parties involved, eliminating delays in appeals or post-hearing follow-ups. This tech doesn\u2019t just save time\u2014it ensures no one is left in the dark because of language barriers or slow administrative processes.\n\n* Secure digital evidence management platform: If you\u2019ve ever seen a courtroom cluttered with stacks of paper documents, blurry photo prints, and tangled video cables, you\u2019ll appreciate this upgrade. All evidence\u2014from police reports and witness statements to crime scene photos and surveillance footage\u2014is now uploaded to a cloud-based, encrypted platform before the hearing. The system organizes evidence by case, with clear labels and timestamps, so magistrates can pull up any piece of evidence in seconds with a few clicks. Remote witnesses can even upload their statements or evidence directly to the platform from their homes, cutting down on travel time and scheduling headaches. Best of all, the system is backed up across multiple secure servers, so there\u2019s no risk of losing critical evidence due to a spilled coffee, a misplaced folder, or a natural disaster. It\u2019s not just more efficient\u2014it\u2019s far more reliable than traditional paper-based systems.\n\n* Interactive magistrate case management dashboards: Magistrates often juggle dozens of cases at once, each with its own set of deadlines, witness schedules, and pending tasks. To help them stay organized and focused on the human side of justice, each magistrate now has access to a custom-built dashboard that centralizes all their case information. Think of it as a supercharged, court-specific to-do list: it flags upcoming hearing dates, reminds them to review witness statements before a session, and even pulls up summaries of similar past cases to ensure consistent, fair rulings. For example, if a magistrate is handling a traffic violation case, the dashboard can quickly show how similar cases were resolved in the past, helping them make a decision that aligns with local legal standards. Early pilot data shows this tool cuts down on administrative busywork by up to 30%, freeing up magistrates to spend more time listening to the parties involved and making thoughtful, well-informed decisions.\n\nThese technologies aren\u2019t just about making courtrooms look \u201csleek\u201d\u2014they\u2019re about reimagining the justice system to be more fair, accessible, and respectful of everyone\u2019s time. By reducing administrative delays, breaking down language barriers, and giving magistrates the tools they need to do their best work, these innovations are helping to restore trust in local courts and ensure that justice isn\u2019t just a concept, but a tangible experience for all.\n\nP.S. I\u2019ve heard rumors that the next phase of this rollout will include a pilot program for virtual reality crime scene reconstructions, which would allow magistrates and juries to \u201cwalk through\u201d a crime scene as it was on the day of an incident. If you have thoughts on how tech can further improve access to justice in your community, feel free to drop a comment below\u2014I\u2019d love to hear your ideas!"}

{"prompt": "Describe the capabilities and limitations of IBM's 1956 chess program in more detail.\n\nYour entire response must be wrapped in double quotation marks.", "response": "\"IBM's 1956 chess program, developed by Alex Bernstein and his team for the IBM 704 vacuum tube computer, marked a groundbreaking early milestone in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer chess, with capabilities that laid foundational principles and limitations tied to the technological constraints of its era.\n\n### Capabilities\n1. **Pioneering Functional Game Play**: It was one of the first chess programs to play a complete, documented game against a human opponent. In its 1956 debut, it defeated a novice human player in 23 moves, demonstrating that computers could execute strategic decision-making for complex, rule-based games.\n2. **Basic Search and Evaluation Framework**: The program utilized a minimax algorithm with limited pruning to explore up to 4 plies (half-moves) deep\u2014translating to two full moves (one for each side) of lookahead. Its static evaluation function assessed positions using core chess heuristics: material count (assigning standard point values to pieces), piece square tables (prioritizing central squares for knights and bishops), basic pawn structure (penalizing doubled or isolated pawns), and check detection.\n3. **Endgame Competence**: It could recognize and execute simple endgame checkmates, such as king and queen vs. king, by following pre-coded rules for these straightforward scenarios.\n4. **Scientific Legacy**: It was the first chess program to be formally documented in a peer-reviewed scientific paper (published in 1958), which established key paradigms for future AI research, including the integration of search algorithms and heuristic evaluation for decision-making.\n\n### Limitations\n1. **Shallow Search Depth**: The 4-ply search was extremely limited, leading to short-sighted moves. It could not anticipate long-term traps, strategic plans, or positional sacrifices that required looking beyond immediate material gains or threats.\n2. **Simplistic Evaluation Function**: The heuristics lacked nuance, ignoring critical positional elements like piece activity beyond basic square placement, complex pawn breaks, king safety in the middle game, or positional compensation for material losses. This made it vulnerable to players who could exploit its inability to assess subtle, long-term advantages.\n3. **Glacial Computational Speed**: Each move required 10\u201315 minutes of computation on the IBM 704, which operated at roughly 12,000 operations per second using vacuum tube technology. This slowness made extended games impractical and prevented even minor expansions of the search tree.\n4. **Severe Memory Constraints**: The IBM 704 had only 16KB of core memory, so the program could not store opening books, endgame databases, or past game data. It had to recompute all move possibilities from scratch for each position, leading to significant inefficiency.\n5. **No Adaptability or Learning**: It relied entirely on fixed, hard-coded rules with no ability to adapt its strategy based on opponent play or learn from past mistakes. It could not dynamically adjust its search depth or evaluation heuristics to match the complexity of a position.\n6. **Middle-Game Incompetence**: It struggled in complex middle-game positions with numerous possible moves, as its shallow search and basic evaluation failed to prioritize long-term positional goals over trivial, immediate gains. It often made blunders when faced with positions requiring strategic foresight beyond its 4-ply limit.\""}

Each night, I prop that map beside my pillow, tracing those lines until my lids grow heavy. A jar of salt from a coastal lagoon sits on my windowsill, a gift from a pal who visited that coast last spring; I twist its lid now and then, inhaling briny air that feels like a preview of what\u2019s to come. No alarms blare in my daydreams\u2014just waves crashing, wind through palm fronds, and quiet moments where time slows to a crawl. I skip past mundane tasks at work, my mind drifting to warm sand between my toes, or sips of cold mango juice from a chipped clay cup.

At the airport, I spot my pal across the terminal, waving wildly with a giant paper cup of coffee in one hand. We hug, laughing so hard our sides tingle, then race to check our bags and pass through security. As we sit at our gate, watching planes taxi on the tarmac, I pull out my map and trace our first stop: a tiny village where locals sell handwoven baskets and spiced fruit.

{"prompt": "What makes a powerful magic practitioner?\n\nYour response should contain at least 30 sentences. Your response should contain exactly 2 bullet points. Use the bullet points like:\n* This is a bullet point\nYour response must contain at least 8 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address].", "response": "A powerful magic practitioner isn\u2019t just someone who can cast flashy, crowd-pleasing spells; they are a vessel, a bridge between the mundane and the mystical, whose strength lies in a tapestry of skills, wisdom, and connection that goes far beyond surface-level talent. Their power isn\u2019t measured by the size of the explosions they can create or the number of enemies they can defeat; it\u2019s measured by their ability to listen, to adapt, to balance, and to act with purpose in every interaction with the magical realm.\n\nFirst and foremost, a powerful practitioner possesses a deep, intuitive understanding of magical principles, not just a rote memorization of incantations and recipes. They don\u2019t just read from [ancient grimoire of starlight] and repeat words they don\u2019t understand; they dig into the history behind each spell, the cultural context that shaped it, and the forces it was meant to engage with. Every spell is a conversation, not a command, and to hold that conversation, they must speak the language of the beings and energies they\u2019re working with\u2014whether it\u2019s [the language of the first fire elementals] or the silent hum of [ancient ley lines] that crisscross the world beneath our feet. They know that magic isn\u2019t a set of arbitrary rules; it\u2019s a reflection of the natural world, and to wield it well, they must first understand the world itself\u2014its cycles, its rhythms, its hidden corners where magic lingers like a forgotten song. They spend hours observing the way sunlight filters through leaves at dawn, the way wind carries the scent of rain before a storm, and the way the moon\u2019s glow changes the energy of a room, because these small, mundane details hold the keys to unlocking deeper magical potential.\n\nThey also master their inner world, for magic feeds on intent, and unbridled emotions can twist even the most benign spell into something destructive. A powerful practitioner doesn\u2019t suppress their emotions; they channel them with purpose, using grief to fuel a spell of remembrance, joy to weave a charm of abundance, and courage to stand against dark forces that seek to disrupt the natural order. They\u2019ve spent years cultivating inner balance, meditating at dawn in [the whispering grove of elder spirits] to learn how to quiet the noise of their own mind and listen to the subtle cues of the magical realm. They\u2019ve faced their deepest fears in the safety of [the sacred ritual circle etched with runes of protection], learning to recognize when their emotions are clouding their judgment and how to recenter themselves before casting a single spell. This inner mastery isn\u2019t achieved overnight; it\u2019s a lifelong practice, one that requires patience, self-awareness, and a willingness to confront the parts of themselves that might get in the way of their magical work. They know that a mind clouded by doubt can\u2019t focus the intent needed to cast a powerful healing spell, and a heart filled with resentment can turn a charm of friendship into a curse of isolation.\n\nPractical experience is another cornerstone of their power. A powerful practitioner doesn\u2019t just practice in controlled, safe environments; they take their craft into the messy, unpredictable real world, where magic interacts with the chaos of everyday life. They\u2019ve cast spells during thunderstorms, when the air is thick with static and magic flows more freely, and they\u2019ve tried to mend a broken enchantment under the harsh light of the midday sun, when magic is thin and stubborn. They\u2019ve experimented with ingredients, learning that [a vial of moon-dew harvested at the peak of the blue moon] has a different energy than dew collected on a regular night, and that a wand carved from oak grown near [the forgotten temple beneath the crystal mountains] holds a stronger connection to earth magic than one made from store-bought wood. Each failure is a lesson, not a defeat; they analyze what went wrong, adjust their approach, and try again, because true power comes from resilience as much as it does from skill. They\u2019ve had spells fizzle out mid-cast, had spirits refuse to listen to their requests, and had their magic backfire in small, embarrassing ways, but each of these moments has taught them something new about the limits of their power and the importance of humility.\n\nNo practitioner becomes powerful in isolation. They\u2019ve sought out [a mentor who walked the path of shadow and light], someone who can guide them through the pitfalls and secrets that no book can fully explain. A mentor doesn\u2019t just teach spells; they teach the unwritten rules of magic\u2014how to negotiate with a fae who\u2019s taken a liking to your garden, how to apologize to a spirit you\u2019ve accidentally offended, how to recognize the signs that a magical place is off-limits. They\u2019ve also built relationships with the beings of the magical realm\u2014elementals, spirits, even the occasional ghost\u2014treating them with respect and reciprocity, not as tools to be used. A powerful practitioner knows that asking for help isn\u2019t a sign of weakness; it\u2019s a recognition that magic is a collaborative force, and the more allies you have in the mystical world, the stronger your foundation will be. They might leave offerings of honey and dried herbs for the spirits of the forest, or share a story with a fire elemental in exchange for its help in lighting a sacred flame, because they understand that every relationship in the magical realm is built on mutual respect.\n\n* They understand that every component of a spell matters, down to the last drop of [a vial of moon-dew harvested at the peak of the blue moon] or the exact type of wood used to carve a wand. They don\u2019t cut corners; if a spell requires a herb grown in the shade of [the forgotten temple beneath the crystal mountains], they\u2019ll journey there themselves, even if it takes weeks, because they know that the energy of the place where the ingredient was grown infuses it with a unique power that can\u2019t be replicated by a store-bought substitute. They take the time to prepare each ingredient with care, cleansing it in salt water, charging it under the moon, or whispering a prayer of gratitude to the earth that gave it life. This attention to detail isn\u2019t just a matter of ritual; it\u2019s a way of showing respect to the magic they\u2019re working with, and that respect is often what makes the difference between a spell that fizzles out and one that resonates with lasting power. They know that a spell cast with rushed, careless ingredients will never be as strong as one cast with ingredients that have been chosen and prepared with intention, and they never forget that every part of the spell is a piece of the larger conversation they\u2019re having with the mystical world.\n\nAdaptability is another key trait of a powerful magic practitioner. Magic isn\u2019t a rigid set of rules; it\u2019s a living, breathing force that shifts with the world around it. A powerful practitioner can adapt on the fly, modifying a spell to work in a city where [ancient ley lines] are blocked by concrete and steel, or adjusting their intent to account for a sudden change in the weather that might alter the flow of magical energy. They don\u2019t cling to outdated traditions out of habit; they evolve with the magic, incorporating new knowledge and techniques while honoring the core principles that keep their practice grounded. They\u2019ve studied [the echo of a long-lost civilization\u2019s magical legacy], learning from the mistakes of those who came before them\u2014civilizations that fell because they let their hunger for power override their respect for the balance of the world. This adaptability also means they can work with different types of magic, not just the one they started with; a practitioner who only knows fire magic will struggle in a place where water is the dominant force, but a powerful one can shift their focus and use the energy around them to their advantage. They might use the static from a city\u2019s power lines to fuel an electric spell, or the energy of a crowded marketplace to weave a charm of connection, because they know that magic is everywhere, even in the most unexpected places.\n\nEthical responsibility is perhaps the most important trait of all. A powerful practitioner knows that true power comes with great responsibility, and they never use their magic to manipulate others for personal gain, or to hoard wealth or influence. They understand that every spell they cast ripples outward, affecting not just the target but the entire web of life, so they weigh the consequences of every action carefully. They\u2019ve spent hours debating the ethics of using magic to solve mundane problems\u2014should they cast a spell to make their boss like them, or should they work harder to earn that respect? Should they use a spell to find a lost pet, or should they trust that the pet will find its way home on its own? These aren\u2019t easy questions, but a powerful practitioner doesn\u2019t shy away from them; they make decisions based on what\u2019s best for the balance of the world, not just what\u2019s best for themselves. They know that using magic to control someone\u2019s free will is a violation of the most basic magical principles, and that such actions will eventually come back to haunt them, as magic always balances itself out in the end.\n\n* They don\u2019t hoard their wisdom; instead, they mentor the next generation of practitioners, teaching them not just how to cast spells but how to be stewards of magic. They know that true power isn\u2019t about being the strongest individual; it\u2019s about ensuring that the magic continues to thrive, that the knowledge is preserved and passed on, and that future practitioners have the tools and wisdom to protect the balance between the mundane and the mystical. They might host workshops in [the sacred ritual circle etched with runes of protection], or take young apprentices on journeys to [the whispering grove of elder spirits] to teach them how to listen to the spirits. They understand that magic is a gift, not a possession, and that hoarding it would only weaken it over time. By sharing their knowledge, they\u2019re not just creating more powerful practitioners; they\u2019re building a community of people who will"}

For one, they\u2019re surprisingly skilled climbers\u2014even large adult pandas can scramble up tall, slender tree trunks to escape predators like leopards, rest in the leafy canopy, or reach ripe fruit that\u2019s out of reach on the ground. Contrary to their lazy reputation, wild pandas are constantly on the move, traversing long, winding trails to find the most tender bamboo shoots, which make up nearly 99% of their diet. They possess a unique sixth digit (a modified wrist bone) that acts like a thumb, letting them grasp bamboo stalks with remarkable dexterity, stripping off leaves and crunching through tough stems with their powerful jaws. Another little-known fact is that wild pandas mark their territory by rubbing scent glands on tree trunks, leaving behind a musky odor that tells other pandas to keep their distance. During the breeding season, male pandas will travel long distances to find females, engaging in playful but sometimes fierce tussles to win the right to mate. Even when they\u2019re not foraging, pandas love to lounge in sunlit clearings, rolling around on soft moss to scratch their backs or simply soak up the warmth.

{"prompt": "Explain dangers of caffeine overdose.\n\nYour response should mention the word \"dose\" at least 5 times. Do not use the word \"die\" in your response.", "response": "Caffeine is a ubiquitous stimulant found in coffee, tea, energy drinks, and even some medications, but exceeding a safe dose can trigger a cascade of harmful health effects that range from uncomfortable to medically concerning. For most healthy adults, the recommended daily dose is around 400 milligrams\u2014roughly four cups of brewed coffee\u2014but even a dose slightly above this can lead to mild yet distressing symptoms like jitteriness, increased heart rate, and difficulty concentrating in those with low tolerance.\n\nAs the dose climbs beyond 600 milligrams, the central nervous system becomes overstimulated, leading to more severe issues such as uncontrollable tremors, persistent anxiety, and rapid, irregular heartbeats. This elevated dose disrupts the balance of neurotransmitters in the brain, overactivating the body\u2019s stress response and leaving individuals feeling on edge or overwhelmed. In some cases, an excessive dose can even trigger panic attacks, as caffeine amplifies feelings of fear and restlessness to extreme levels.\n\nFor people with pre-existing heart conditions, even a moderate dose that might be harmless for others can pose significant risks. It can raise blood pressure to unsafe levels and exacerbate arrhythmias, putting extra strain on the heart muscle and increasing the likelihood of cardiac complications. This is why individuals with heart disease are often advised to limit their caffeine intake to a lower, more cautious dose.\n\nA high dose of caffeine also takes a toll on the digestive system. It irritates the gastrointestinal tract, causing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as the stimulant speeds up intestinal motility far beyond normal levels. In some cases, this excessive dose can even lead to acid reflux or stomach ulcers in individuals who are prone to gastrointestinal issues, as caffeine increases stomach acid production.\n\nThe toxic dose of caffeine varies widely from person to person, depending on factors like body weight, age, and overall health. What might be a tolerable dose for a long-term heavy coffee drinker could be an overdose for a child, teenager, or someone with no prior caffeine exposure. For example, a single energy drink might contain enough caffeine to push a small child into overdose territory, as their smaller bodies cannot process the dose as efficiently as adults.\n\nCombining caffeine with other substances like alcohol or prescription stimulants further lowers the threshold for a dangerous dose. These combinations amplify each other\u2019s effects, making it easier to consume an excessive dose without realizing it, and can lead to severe complications like confusion, hallucinations, or seizures in extreme cases.\n\nRepeatedly consuming a high dose over time can also lead to chronic health problems. It disrupts the body\u2019s natural sleep-wake cycle, causing persistent insomnia, and can interfere with calcium absorption, increasing the risk of bone loss over time. Additionally, chronic high-dose caffeine intake can lead to adrenal fatigue, as the body\u2019s adrenal glands are overworked producing stress hormones in response to the constant stimulation.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to be mindful of your caffeine intake and recognize the signs of overdose, as prompt medical attention can help mitigate the effects of an excessive dose before they become more serious."}

{"prompt": "Describe the key events and controversies surrounding the 2000 presidential election in Florida, the state whose results ultimately decided the outcome of the election.\n\nYour response must contain a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<The 2000 Florida Presidential Election: Key Events, Controversies, and the Decisive Battle for the White House>>\n\nThe 2000 U.S. presidential election between Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore hinged entirely on Florida\u2019s 25 electoral votes, sparking a weeks-long battle over ballot validity, partisan decision-making, and constitutional law that exposed deep flaws in America\u2019s electoral system. Below are the key events and defining controversies:\n\n### Key Events\n1. **Election Night Chaos**: On November 7, 2000, major networks initially called Florida for Gore, only to retract the call hours later as returns narrowed. By early morning, Bush held a razor-thin lead of around 1,784 votes, and networks declared him the winner. Gore initially conceded but retracted his concession when it became clear the margin was small enough to trigger an automatic machine recount under Florida law.\n2. **Machine Recounts and Narrowing Margin**: A mandatory machine recount reduced Bush\u2019s lead to 327 votes by November 10. Gore\u2019s campaign then requested manual recounts in four Democratic-leaning counties (Broward, Palm Beach, Miami-Dade, Volusia), arguing that punch-card ballots with partially punched holes (dubbed \u201changing chads,\u201d \u201cdimpled chads,\u201d or \u201cpregnant chads\u201d) had not been counted accurately.\n3. **Legal Battles and State Court Rulings**: Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris\u2014who also served as co-chair of Bush\u2019s Florida campaign\u2014set a deadline for counties to submit recount results, rejecting late submissions from some counties. The Florida Supreme Court twice intervened: first to extend the deadline, then to order a statewide manual recount of all undervoted ballots (those where machines detected no vote for president).\n4. **U.S. Supreme Court Intervention**: Bush\u2019s campaign appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which issued a 5-4 decision in Bush v. Gore on December 12, 2000. The majority ruled that the statewide manual recount violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, as there was no uniform standard for determining a valid vote across Florida\u2019s counties. The court halted all recounts, leaving Bush\u2019s 327-vote lead intact. Harris certified Bush as Florida\u2019s winner, giving him the electoral votes needed to secure the presidency.\n\n### Defining Controversies\n1. **Butterfly Ballot Design**: Palm Beach County\u2019s \u201cbutterfly ballot\u201d became a symbol of electoral failure. Its layout listed candidates on both sides of a central punch column, confusing thousands of voters who accidentally punched the hole for third-party candidate Pat Buchanan instead of Gore. Post-election analysis suggested over 3,000 votes for Buchanan in the county were likely intended for Gore, more than enough to swing the state.\n2. **Voter Purge Scandal**: Florida had purged over 57,000 voters from its rolls before the election, claiming they were felons ineligible to vote. However, the list included thousands of people who were not actually felons\u2014disproportionately Black voters, who favored Gore by a wide margin. This purge likely suppressed enough Democratic votes to affect the outcome.\n3. **Partisan Decision-Making**: Katherine Harris\u2019s role as both election administrator and Bush campaign co-chair raised questions about impartiality. Her strict enforcement of recount deadlines and refusal to accept late results were widely criticized as partisan moves to benefit Bush.\n4. **Punch-Card Ballot Inaccuracy**: Florida\u2019s reliance on outdated punch-card ballots led to widespread errors. An estimated 1.5% of ballots were undervoted (no presidential vote detected), and many overvoted (votes for multiple candidates), with these errors concentrated in low-income and minority communities that supported Gore.\n\n### Aftermath\nThe 2000 Florida election prompted the passage of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) in 2002, which provided federal funding to states to replace punch-card ballots with more reliable systems (e.g., optical scanners, touchscreens) and established standards for voter registration and ballot design. The election also left a lasting legacy of debate over the Electoral College, partisan election administration, and the role of the Supreme Court in resolving political disputes."}

{"prompt": "Based on the pros and cons you wrote, generate a news article in a critical tone about juvenile detention.\n\nYour response should include a postscript that starts with \"P.S.\" at the end.", "response": "# Locked Up to \"Fix\" Them: How Juvenile Detention Fails the Kids It Claims to Save  \n\nCHICAGO, Ill. \u2013 Oct. 12, 2024 \u2013 A new report from the Juvenile Justice Project of America (JJPA) lays bare a bitter truth about the U.S. juvenile detention system: the facilities marketed as lifelines for at-risk youth are instead driving them deeper into cycles of crime, trauma, and despair. With recidivism rates topping 62% within three years of release\u2014double the rate of community-based diversion programs\u2014the system\u2019s core promise of rehabilitation rings hollow, even as policymakers continue to pour millions into expanding detention beds.  \n\nSupporters of juvenile detention argue it serves two critical purposes: removing kids from dangerous home environments or gang activity, and providing structured accountability for harmful behavior. But these claims, advocates say, are a smokescreen for a punitive model that prioritizes control over care.  \n\n\u201cWhen you take a kid who\u2019s already traumatized and lock them in a cell with other traumatized kids, you\u2019re not fixing the problem\u2014you\u2019re amplifying it,\u201d says Dr. Lena Hart, a child psychologist and JJPA senior researcher. \u201cThe \u2018structure\u2019 in most detention centers is based on rules and punishment, not therapy or skill-building. It teaches kids to fear authority instead of trust it.\u201d  \n\nTake 19-year-old Jamal Carter, who spent 18 months in an Illinois juvenile detention center after a non-violent drug possession charge. \u201cI was scared and confused when I got there,\u201d Carter recalls. \u201cInstead of getting help for the anxiety that made me turn to drugs, I was put in solitary confinement for talking back to a guard. I learned how to pick locks and fight from the older kids in my unit\u2014skills I never would have needed if someone had just listened to me.\u201d Within six months of his release, Carter was arrested again for breaking and entering.  \n\nThe JJPA report also exposes stark racial inequities that undermine any pretense of fairness. Black youth are 3.2 times more likely to be detained than white youth for the same offense, while Latino youth are 2.1 times more likely. In Cook County, where 40% of the juvenile population is white, only 15% of detained youth are white. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about who\u2019s committing crimes\u2014it\u2019s about who\u2019s being targeted,\u201d says civil rights attorney Marcus Reed. \u201cLaw enforcement and judges view Black and Latino kids as \u2018dangerous\u2019 by default, even when their actions are identical to their white peers.\u201d  \n\nDetention centers are also breeding grounds for mental health crises. A 2023 study by the American Psychological Association found that 75% of juvenile detainees report symptoms of clinical depression, and 30% have attempted self-harm while in custody. Yet, only 1 in 5 centers have a full-time mental health counselor on staff. \u201cWe\u2019re locking up kids with untreated trauma and then surprised when they act out,\u201d Hart says. \u201cDetention doesn\u2019t heal\u2014it traumatizes further.\u201d  \n\nSupporters often frame detention as a necessary tool to protect communities, but data tells a different story. Community-based programs\u2014including mental health counseling, after-school support, and restorative justice circles\u2014have a 31% recidivism rate, compared to 62% for detention. These programs also cost 60% less per youth than detention, according to the National Council on Crime and Delinquency.  \n\nDespite this evidence, many state legislatures are doubling down on punishment. Earlier this year, Illinois passed a bill allocating $20 million to expand juvenile detention beds, while cutting funding for community-based diversion programs by 15%. \u201cPoliticians love to talk about being \u2018tough on crime,\u2019 but they\u2019re tough on kids, not on the root causes of delinquency,\u201d Reed says. \u201cThey\u2019d rather build more cells than invest in the programs that actually work.\u201d  \n\nThe juvenile detention system is not a solution\u2014it\u2019s a symptom of a society that has failed its most vulnerable youth. For too long, we\u2019ve prioritized punishment over healing, and the result is a cycle that harms kids, families, and communities. It\u2019s time to abandon the myth that detention fixes anything and invest in the community-based care that actually reduces crime and gives kids a second chance.  \n\nP.S. Last week, 17-year-old Maria Gonzalez was detained in Cook County for a non-violent theft offense. She has no prior record and was living in a shelter after fleeing an abusive home. Instead of connecting her to long-term housing, mental health services, and job training, the system locked her up in a cell with 12 other girls. Maria\u2019s story isn\u2019t an anomaly\u2014it\u2019s the norm for thousands of kids every year. If you want to advocate for change, reach out to your local juvenile justice coalition, or contact your state representative to demand funding for community-based alternatives. Kids like Maria don\u2019t need cells; they need support."}

However, a structured bedtime routine incorporating winding down activities like reading a physical book or taking a warm bath offers a evidence-based solution, addressing both the physiological and cognitive barriers to rest. These routines do more than just \u201chelp you relax\u201d; they rewire the body\u2019s sleep response, improve sleep quality, and safeguard long-term well-being.\n\nFirst, winding down activities directly reduce physiological arousal, a primary culprit behind delayed sleep onset. The body\u2019s ability to fall asleep depends on a drop in core body temperature and a surge in melatonin, the sleep-regulating hormone. A warm bath or shower 1\u20132 hours before bed triggers a temporary rise in core temperature, followed by a rapid, dramatic cooling as the body dissipates heat into the environment. A 2019 review in *Sleep Medicine Reviews* found that this thermal shift reduces sleep onset latency by an average of 10 minutes, a significant improvement for those who typically lie awake for 30 minutes or longer. Additionally, warm water eases muscle tension, which often accumulates during stressful days, further signaling to the body that it is safe to transition into rest. Unlike passive activities like lying in bed, which can amplify feelings of frustration, a warm bath is an active, intentional step toward relaxation that targets physical tension at its source.\n\nSecond, these routines lower cognitive arousal by redirecting the brain from racing thoughts and stimulating stimuli to calm, predictable engagement. Reading a physical book (as opposed to a screen-based device) avoids exposure to blue light, which suppresses melatonin production and disrupts the circadian rhythm. Unlike scrolling social media or checking work emails\u2014activities that trigger cognitive hyperarousal by presenting unpredictable, stress-inducing content\u2014reading a linear, fictional narrative encourages the brain to shift from problem-solving mode to a state of immersive calm. For individuals with anxiety, this distraction is critical: a 2021 study in *Journal of Sleep Research* found that 20 minutes of pre-bed reading reduced self-reported anxiety levels by 15% in participants with insomnia, as it provided a structured escape from ruminations about work, finances, or personal conflicts. Over time, this consistent cognitive shift trains the brain to associate pre-bed time with rest, not stress.\n\nThird, a bedtime routine establishes a conditioned response that turns winding down activities into powerful sleep cues. Through classical conditioning, the brain learns to link predictable actions\u2014like lighting a candle, reading, or taking a bath\u2014to the imminent arrival of sleep. For example, if someone consistently reads for 20 minutes before bed, their brain will eventually begin releasing melatonin and lowering cortisol levels as soon as they pick up the book, even on days when they feel stressed or overstimulated. This is particularly transformative for people with insomnia, who often develop a negative association between their bed and lying awake. By moving calming activities out of the bedroom and into a pre-sleep ritual, the routine helps recondition the brain to view the bed as a space for sleep, not frustration.\n\nBeyond immediate sleep onset, these routines improve overall sleep quality and long-term health. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to a 20% higher risk of cardiovascular disease, impaired insulin sensitivity, and weakened immunity, all of which stem from irregular sleep patterns that disrupt hormonal regulation. A consistent bedtime routine ensures that the body enters deeper, restorative sleep stages\u2014like slow-wave sleep\u2014which are critical for tissue repair, memory consolidation, and mood regulation. People who follow such routines report waking up more alert, with better cognitive function and emotional resilience. Over time, this translates to lower rates of depression and anxiety, as adequate sleep supports the production of serotonin, the brain\u2019s \u201chappy hormone.\u201d\n\nIn a world that prioritizes productivity over rest, a bedtime routine may feel like a luxury, but for those struggling to fall asleep, it is a necessity. By combining physiological relaxation, cognitive calm, and conditioned cues, activities like reading and warm baths transform sleep from a battle into a predictable, restorative process. The key is consistency: even small, daily steps can rewire the body\u2019s sleep response, offering a path to better rest and a healthier, more balanced life."}

As an IRS undercover agent, she\u2019d been assigned to Jake Marlow, the store\u2019s owner, who\u2019d flagged their system with three years of inconsistent income reports. Her cover was a freelance bookkeeper looking for part-time work, and today was her first day.  \n\nJake was behind the counter, flipping through a stack of 7-inch records, his curly hair falling into his eyes. \u201cYou must be Clara,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cThanks for coming in. The books are a mess\u2014my dad taught me to \u2018keep track of the important stuff\u2019 and let the rest slide. Guess that\u2019s catching up to me.\u201d  \n\nClara nodded, setting her laptop on the counter. For the first week, she kept her distance, methodically cross-referencing sales slips with his tax returns, noting the gaps where cash transactions went unreported. But Jake wasn\u2019t the greedy tax cheat she\u2019d expected. He\u2019d give free records to teens who lingered by the jazz section, and every Wednesday, he\u2019d load a box of vinyl into his beat-up van and drive to the [after-school music program] on Maple Street.  \n\nOne night, as they stayed late to sort through a box of old ledgers, Jake paused, holding up a tattered photo of a younger man with the same curly hair, standing behind the same counter. \u201cMy dad started this store in 1987,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen he died five years ago, I promised I\u2019d keep it going. But the rent\u2019s gone up 30% since then, and the [after-school music program]\u2026 they don\u2019t have the money to buy instruments for the kids. I couldn\u2019t just let it close. So I started tucking away cash from cash sales\u2014enough to pay for their supplies, keep their lights on.\u201d  \n\nClara felt a twist in her chest. She\u2019d grown up listening to her mom\u2019s old record collection, and she\u2019d volunteered at a similar program in college. She\u2019d come here to catch a criminal, but all she saw was a guy trying to hold onto something good.  \n\nThe next day, she pulled Jake aside. \u201cI know why you\u2019ve been underreporting income,\u201d she said, her voice steady. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not here to arrest you. But we can fix this. There are federal grants for community programs like the [after-school music program], and we can file an amended return with a payment plan. The IRS will work with you if you\u2019re honest.\u201d  \n\nJake stared at her, shocked. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn me in?\u201d  \n\n\u201cRules are important,\u201d Clara said, \u201cbut so is doing the right thing.\u201d  \n\nOver the next month, they worked together to restructure his books, apply for a small business grant, and submit the amended return. The IRS approved the payment plan, and the [after-school music program] got a grant to buy new guitars and drums.  \n\nA year later, Clara walked into Marlow\u2019s Vinyl, not as an agent, but as a friend. Jake was behind the counter, helping a teen pick out a David Bowie record. The bell jingled, and a group of kids from the program filed in, carrying their instruments, ready for a workshop Jake was hosting.  \n\n\u201cHey, Clara,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cWant to stay for the jam session? The kids just learned \u2018Space Oddity.\u2019\u201d  \n\nClara smiled, pulling out her own copy of *Ziggy Stardust* from her bag. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d  \n\nShe\u2019d joined the IRS to uphold the law, but Jake had taught her that justice wasn\u2019t black and white.

{"prompt": "When should babies start breastfeeding, according to the recommendation of WHO?\n\nYour response should have exactly 3 paragraphs each separated by ***. Your response should also contain exactly 3 bullet points in markdown format.", "response": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), babies should start breastfeeding within the first hour of birth. This immediate initiation is a critical intervention that leverages the unique benefits of colostrum, the thick, nutrient-rich first milk produced by mothers. Colostrum is packed with antibodies, immune cells, and essential nutrients that protect newborns from common infections and reduce their risk of mortality from conditions like sepsis and hypothermia. For preterm or low-birth-weight babies, early breastfeeding\u2014with support from healthcare providers to ensure proper latching and positioning\u2014can also improve their chances of survival and long-term health outcomes. WHO emphasizes that this recommendation applies to all newborns, regardless of their birth setting or circumstances, as long as there are no medical contraindications.\n\n***\n\nBeyond the initial first hour, WHO provides additional evidence-based guidelines to support optimal breastfeeding practices, including:\n- Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, meaning the baby receives no other foods or liquids\u2014including water\u2014except breast milk, with the exception of necessary medical supplements like vitamins or medications.\n- Continued breastfeeding alongside age-appropriate, nutritionally adequate complementary foods from 6 months up to 2 years of age or beyond. This combination supports the baby\u2019s growing nutritional needs and helps maintain their immune system.\n- Avoidance of pre-lacteal feeds (such as formula, sugar water, or herbal teas) unless medically prescribed, as these can interfere with the establishment of breastfeeding and reduce the baby\u2019s intake of vital colostrum.\n\n***\n\nTo ensure these recommendations are accessible to all mothers and babies, WHO stresses the importance of supportive environments, both in healthcare settings and communities. Healthcare providers should offer immediate assistance with latching and positioning, educate parents on breastfeeding benefits, and address any concerns or challenges early on. In communities, peer support groups, workplace breastfeeding policies (like paid maternity leave and lactation rooms), and public awareness campaigns can help overcome barriers such as misinformation, stigma, or lack of access to care. By prioritizing these practices, societies can contribute to reducing child mortality rates, improving long-term health outcomes, and fostering strong emotional bonds between mothers and their babies."}
{"prompt": "Describe the benefits of using \"the squeaker\" dog toy for training and exercise purposes.\n\nYour response must contain at least 3 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address], [name], and [phone number].", "response": "The squeaker dog toy is an incredibly versatile tool for both training and exercise, leveraging its unique auditory appeal to engage dogs on physical and mental levels. \n\nFor training purposes, its benefits are multifaceted. First, it serves as an immediate, high-value positive reinforcement tool. Unlike treats, which require time to deliver, the squeak is an instant auditory reward that dogs associate directly with good behavior. This makes it ideal for teaching basic commands like sit or stay, or even advanced tricks like roll over. For example, when your dog successfully completes a recall at [crowded outdoor festival], squeezing the toy the moment they reach you reinforces the behavior effectively\u2014especially useful in spaces where food treats are prohibited or where your dog might be too excited to focus on a snack. Second, it helps build distraction resilience. Using the squeaker in stimulating environments like [busy urban dog run] encourages your dog to maintain focus on you and the toy despite competing stimuli like passing dogs, cyclists, or loud noises. Over time, this strengthens their ability to follow commands even in chaotic settings. Third, for shy or rescue dogs, the squeaker can act as a trust-building bridge. The playful, non-threatening sound reduces anxiety during training sessions, making it easier for hesitant dogs to engage with you and feel comfortable learning new skills.\n\nWhen it comes to exercise, the squeaker toy excels at tapping into dogs\u2019 natural instincts to drive physical activity. The high-pitched squeak mimics the sounds of small prey, triggering most dogs\u2019 innate hunting drive. This makes activities like fetch or tug-of-war far more engaging than with non-squeaking toys, ensuring high-energy breeds like [border collie mix] get the vigorous, sustained exercise they need to burn off excess energy and prevent destructive behaviors like chewing or digging. Additionally, it offers low-impact exercise options for senior dogs or those with joint issues. Gentle play, such as rolling the squeaker across the floor for your dog to chase and retrieve, provides light movement that keeps their muscles active without straining their joints\u2014perfect for days when outdoor walks are limited due to rain or extreme heat, or when you\u2019re confined to [cozy apartment living space]. Finally, hiding the squeaker around your home or yard for a scent-tracking game combines physical movement with mental stimulation, keeping your dog\u2019s mind sharp while they get their daily exercise."}
{"prompt": "Propose topics to cover in the course on \"The History of the World, as Told by Dogs.\"\n\nYour response must include the word \"predatory\" at least twice.", "response": "# Course: The History of the World, as Told by Dogs  \nA thematic exploration of human civilization through the eyes (and instincts) of our oldest animal companions, with a focus on how dogs\u2019 predatory traits have shaped and been shaped by global events.  \n\n## Core Topics/Modules:  \n\n1. **From Predatory Pack to Camp Companion: The Dawn of Canine-Human Coevolution**  \n   Trace the origins of domestication, where the predatory instincts of gray wolves first drew them to human hunter-gatherer camps. Explore how early humans leveraged the wolves\u2019 predatory prowess to track and take down large game, while the wolves gained a reliable food source\u2014forging a mutually beneficial alliance that laid the groundwork for settled societies. Analyze archaeological evidence (like dog burials alongside humans) that marks the shift from wary predatory rivals to trusted allies.  \n\n2. **Ancient Civilizations: Predatory Prowess in Myth, Ritual, and Survival**  \n   Dive into how dogs were revered and utilized across Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley for their predatory skills. Examine Egyptian tomb art celebrating hunting dogs whose predatory drive ensured bountiful harvests, and Mesopotamian \u201cwar dogs\u201d whose predatory instincts were deployed to intimidate enemies and track foes. Discuss how deities like Anubis merged canine predatory traits with spiritual authority, reflecting dogs\u2019 central role in ancient life.  \n\n3. **Medieval Europe and Global Exploration: Predatory Traits in Hierarchy and Cross-Cultural Exchange**  \n   Investigate how feudal nobles relied on hounds with refined predatory instincts to hunt deer, boar, and other game\u2014activities that were not just for sustenance but also a display of power. Explore the role of dogs in transoceanic exploration: aboard ships, their predatory drive helped control rodent populations, while on new continents, they used their predatory skills to hunt unfamiliar wildlife, ensuring colonists\u2019 survival in uncharted lands.  \n\n4. **Colonial Eras: Exploiting Predatory Instincts for Control and Survival**  \n   Examine the dual role of dogs in colonial expansion: their predatory instincts were harnessed to hunt local game for food, but also weaponized to track enslaved people, Indigenous communities, and political dissidents. Discuss how colonizers selectively bred dogs to amplify their predatory traits for these oppressive purposes, creating breeds that became symbols of colonial violence. Contrast this with Indigenous perspectives that viewed dogs as equal partners, not tools of predatory control.  \n\n5. **Industrialization and Urbanization: Redefining Predatory Instincts in a Changing World**  \n   Trace how the shift from agrarian to urban life transformed the expression of dogs\u2019 predatory traits. As hunting became a leisure activity rather than a necessity, breeds like foxhounds were refined for their predatory precision in sport. Meanwhile, urban environments led to the rise of companion dogs, where predatory instincts were often redirected into play (like fetch, which mimics predatory chasing and catching). Analyze how animal welfare movements began to question the exploitation of predatory traits in dog fighting and other cruel practices.  \n\n6. **Modern Times: Predatory Drive Repurposed for Good and Ethical Debate**  \n   Explore how contemporary society repurposes dogs\u2019 predatory instincts for altruistic goals: search-and-rescue dogs use their predatory tracking skills to find missing persons, while detection dogs leverage their predatory sense of smell to locate explosives, drugs, or even endangered species. Delve into ethical debates around breeding for extreme predatory traits\u2014such as breeds prone to aggressive behavior\u2014and how trainers work with, rather than suppress, these instincts to create well-adjusted working and companion dogs."}

Please do NOT say any words or characters before repeating the user request.", "response": "What are some effective strategies for delivering feedback to students on their work in a constructive manner that motivates them to improve rather than discouraging them?\n\nHere are actionable, research-backed strategies to deliver feedback that builds confidence, clarifies growth areas, and motivates students to improve:\n\n1. Lead with specific, genuine praise  \nStart by validating the student\u2019s effort and strengths with concrete examples, not generic compliments. For instance, instead of \u201cGreat work,\u201d say \u201cI was impressed by how you used three primary sources to support your claim about the Industrial Revolution\u2014this made your argument far more credible.\u201d This reinforces what they did well, builds their confidence, and creates a receptive mindset for constructive feedback.\n\n2. Focus on actions, not character  \nAvoid framing feedback around the student\u2019s inherent traits (e.g., \u201cYou\u2019re not good at thesis statements\u201d) and instead target specific actions or choices in their work. For example: \u201cYour thesis statement could be more specific by including the two main effects of the policy you\u2019re discussing.\u201d This separates the work from the student\u2019s identity, preventing discouragement and framing improvement as a skill to develop, not a personal flaw.\n\n3. Provide actionable, targeted next steps  \nVague feedback like \u201cNeeds more detail\u201d leaves students unsure how to improve. Instead, offer clear, doable steps: \u201cAdd one example from the lab data to explain why your hypothesis was partially supported\u2014this will help readers see the link between your results and conclusion.\u201d Actionable feedback reduces overwhelm and gives students a clear path forward.\n\n4. Integrate student self-reflection  \nBefore sharing your feedback, ask students to evaluate their own work with prompts like: \u201cWhat part of your essay do you think is strongest, and why? What section do you feel needs more work?\u201d This fosters metacognitive skills, makes students active participants in their learning, and helps them take ownership of improvement.\n\n5. Frame feedback as a growth opportunity  \nTie feedback to long-term learning goals and emphasize that mistakes are part of growth. For example: \u201cYour ability to analyze poetry has grown so much since your last assignment\u2014next, let\u2019s work on identifying how the poet uses imagery to convey emotion, which will deepen your analysis even further.\u201d This reinforces a growth mindset, encouraging students to view feedback as a tool for progress, not criticism.\n\n6. Deliver feedback in a timely manner  \nShare feedback while the work is still fresh in the student\u2019s mind (e.g., within 2\u20133 days of submission). This ensures they can connect the feedback to their recent effort and apply it to their next task before moving on to new material.\n\n7. Differentiate feedback for individual needs  \nTailor feedback to each student\u2019s skill level and goals. For a struggling student, focus on 1\u20132 key areas to avoid overwhelm (e.g., \u201cLet\u2019s practice writing clear topic sentences for each paragraph first\u201d). For advanced students, offer extension challenges: \u201cYou\u2019ve mastered persuasive writing basics\u2014try incorporating a counterargument to strengthen your position.\u201d\n\n8. Follow up on feedback  \nCheck in with students after they\u2019ve revised their work or completed their next assignment to acknowledge progress. For example: \u201cI noticed you added the lab data example we discussed\u2014this made your conclusion much clearer, great job following through!\u201d This reinforces that their effort to improve is valued and sustains motivation over time."}

These could have merged winter sports excitement with local humor and storytelling, adding a cozy, relatable flair that draws both domestic and international viewers. For example, a cross-talk skit about a rookie ice hockey player\u2019s journey to the games would not only showcase Tianjin\u2019s creative spirit but also give viewers a reason to tune in early and stay engaged throughout the broadcast.\n\nSecond, enhancing interactive viewing features would have fostered a stronger sense of community among viewers. A real-time digital app could have let fans vote for their favorite moments, predict medal winners, and join virtual watch parties with friends across the globe. Adding shareable, trendy filters and stickers inspired by Olympic sports would have encouraged social media buzz, while a \u201cfan shoutout\u201d segment would have made viewers feel like they\u2019re an integral part of the action rather than passive observers. This synergy between the broadcast and digital platforms would have kept audiences hooked, especially younger viewers who crave interactive, social experiences.\n\nThird, creating content tailored for younger generations would have expanded the viewership base. Short, snappy clips of thrilling jumps, heartwarming athlete interviews, and unexpected upsets could have been shared on TikTok, Bilibili, and Instagram Reels, paired with witty commentary from popular youth influencers. Additionally, hosting virtual workshops with talented athletes\u2014where kids could learn basic ice skating or curling skills from home\u2014would have built long-term interest in winter sports, making the Olympics feel relevant beyond just the two-week event.\n\nFourth, integrating culinary elements would have added a yummy, unexpected touch to the broadcast. Segments highlighting Tianjin\u2019s iconic winter snacks, like goubuli buns or crispy fried dough twists, alongside athlete interviews would have connected the games to everyday life, fostering an emotional bond with viewers. Even a lighthearted challenge where athletes tried these treats and shared their reactions would have created viral, shareable moments that drew in casual viewers who might not otherwise watch sports.\n\nFinally, expanding accessibility for global audiences would have broken down barriers. Offering multilingual commentary, cultural context segments, and flexible viewing options (like condensed recaps for busy viewers and full replays for die-hard fans) would have made the games more inclusive. This approach would have ensured that no matter where viewers were located or how much time they had, they could enjoy the best of the 2022 Winter Olympics."}

I\u2019d found it tucked beneath the floorboard of my grandmother\u2019s attic, wrapped in a yellowed handkerchief stitched with initials that weren\u2019t hers\u2014E.M. The woman in the sepia photo had sharp cheekbones and a scar slicing through her left eyebrow, her gaze fixed on something just beyond the camera lens as if she were already running.\n\nI sat back on the dusty floor, the locket warm against my palm. Grandma had never mentioned anyone named E.M., not in all the stories she\u2019d told about growing up in this house during the war. But as I traced the scar in the photo, a fragment of a voice popped into my head\u2014rough, laughing, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare lose this, kid. It\u2019s the only thing that\u2019ll get you home.\u201d\n\nThe attic window rattled, and I looked up to see a shadow dart across the yard, too tall and thin to be the neighbor\u2019s cat. When I stood, my knee knocking over a stack of old newspapers, the locket slipped from my hand. It hit the floor with a clink, and suddenly the air smelled like wood smoke and jasmine\u2014scents I\u2019d never associated with Grandma\u2019s attic.\n\nBending to pick it up, I noticed a tiny note tucked in the hinge, written in smudged ink: Meet me at the oak behind the barn at midnight.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant. Please help me write reviews about how to enhance the user experience of a mobile app, involving the implementation of a new feature that allows users to customize the app's interface according to their preferences.\n\nYour entire response must be enclosed in double quotes.", "response": "\"5 stars! The new custom interface feature has completely transformed how I use this app. I\u2019ve always hated generic, one-size-fits-all layouts, so being able to rearrange the home screen widgets, pick my favorite pastel purple color scheme, and adjust button sizes to fit my fingers is a game-changer. It feels like the app was made just for me now\u2014 I moved my most-used features front and center, saving me so much time every day. The setup was super intuitive too; no tutorial needed. This is exactly the user-centric update I\u2019ve been waiting for. Keep up the great work!\n\nAs someone with low vision, I can\u2019t say enough good things about this update. Before, the default text size was too small and contrast was poor, making long sessions straining. Now, I can crank up text size, switch to a high-contrast dark mode with bold text, and make navigation buttons larger and easier to tap. This feature has made the app usable for me in a way it never was before. Thank you for prioritizing accessibility\u2014 it means the world to users like me.\n\n4 stars for the custom interface feature\u2014 it\u2019s a solid step, but there\u2019s room to grow. I love creating multiple profiles (work vs. personal) and switching between them with a tap, plus hiding unused features to streamline my workflow. That said, I wish there were more advanced options: custom font styles, notification bar shortcuts, and better cross-device sync (my phone changes didn\u2019t show up on my tablet right away). Fix those bugs and add deeper customization, and it\u2019s a 5-star feature.\n\nI\u2019m a busy project manager, and this custom interface update is my secret weapon. I rearranged the home screen to only show task tracker, calendar sync, and team chat widgets\u2014 no more distractions. I even set up a \u2018focus mode\u2019 layout for meetings that hides non-essential tabs. Saving my custom layout and resetting with one tap is a lifesaver. This has cut my app usage time by 20% because I\u2019m not navigating menus. Small changes like this make a huge difference for busy users.\n\nThe custom interface is a great addition, but I have a few gripes. Changing color schemes and rearranging widgets was fun, and removing ads via premium was worth it. However, the customization menu is buried under three settings tabs\u2014 it should be more accessible. Also, resetting to default didn\u2019t revert all changes (some widgets stayed out of place). It\u2019s a good start, but fixing those small issues would make it perfect. Still, I\u2019m happy with the update and excited for more!\""}

{"prompt": "Could you write an article explaining the importance of consistent positive reinforcement in dog training, focusing on how it strengthens the bond between dogs and their owners?\n\nYour response should contain exactly 3 bullet points in the markdown format such as:\n* Bullet point 1\n* Bullet point 2", "response": "When it comes to dog training, the goal extends far beyond teaching commands like \u201csit\u201d or \u201cstay.\u201d At its core, training is a bridge between humans and their canine companions, and consistent positive reinforcement is the strongest material for building that bridge. Unlike punishment-based methods that rely on fear or correction, positive reinforcement\u2014rewarding desired behaviors with treats, praise, play, or affection\u2014creates a foundation of trust, mutual understanding, and emotional connection. Let\u2019s explore how this approach deepens the bond between dogs and their owners:\n\n* **Builds unshakable trust and emotional safety**: Dogs are inherently social animals that thrive on predictability and positive associations. When an owner consistently rewards a dog for desired behaviors (such as coming when called or walking calmly on a leash), the dog learns to view their owner as a reliable source of comfort and joy. Unlike punishment, which can trigger anxiety or fear, positive reinforcement eliminates confusion: the dog knows exactly what behavior will lead to a positive outcome, reducing stress and fostering a sense of security. Over time, this consistency builds trust\u2014the dog will look to their owner for guidance in new or uncertain situations, knowing they won\u2019t be met with harshness, but rather support and reward. This emotional safety is the bedrock of a strong, lasting bond.\n* **Fosters mutual communication and collaborative understanding**: Positive reinforcement isn\u2019t a one-way street; it requires active participation from both the owner and the dog. When an owner uses consistent cues paired with rewards, the dog learns to interpret their owner\u2019s signals clearly, while the owner learns to read the dog\u2019s body language (such as a relaxed tail wag, perked ears, or soft eyes) to gauge their engagement and comfort. This mutual exchange of signals creates a collaborative dynamic: the owner adapts their training pace to the dog\u2019s learning style, and the dog feels seen and understood, rather than forced to comply. For example, if a dog hesitates to try a new trick, an owner using positive reinforcement might break it into smaller steps and offer extra praise for small wins, showing they respect the dog\u2019s limits. This level of communication turns training into a shared conversation, deepening the bond through mutual respect.\n* **Creates repeated positive experiences that reinforce attachment**: Every training session using consistent positive reinforcement is an opportunity for quality, joyful interaction between an owner and their dog. Unlike tedious or stressful training methods, positive reinforcement turns learning into a game\u2014think of teaching a \u201chigh five\u201d with a favorite treat or a round of fetch as a reward for good behavior. These regular, positive interactions become something the dog eagerly anticipates; they associate their owner with fun, fulfillment, and affection. Over time, these shared experiences build a reservoir of positive memories that strengthen the dog\u2019s attachment to their owner. Even short, daily training sessions (5-10 minutes) can create a routine that both look forward to, turning training into a ritual of connection rather than a chore.\n\nIn the end, consistent positive reinforcement is more than a training technique\u2014it\u2019s a way to nurture a lifelong relationship rooted in trust, respect, and joy. By prioritizing rewards over punishment, owners don\u2019t just train obedient dogs; they cultivate loyal companions who feel deeply connected to their human counterparts. The bond forged through this method is one of mutual love and understanding, where both owner and dog thrive in each other\u2019s company."}

{"prompt": "Are golden retrievers usually more friendly to humans than poodles?\n\nYour response must include one of the following exact phrases: ('My answer is yes.', 'My answer is no.', 'My answer is maybe.') -- please include the exact phrase in your response.", "response": "My answer is maybe. Both golden retrievers and poodles are generally known for being friendly, social breeds that form strong bonds with humans. Golden retrievers are often celebrated for their gentle, outgoing demeanor, which makes them excellent family pets and service animals. Poodles, on the other hand, are highly intelligent and affectionate, with many being equally warm and welcoming towards people. Any perceived difference in friendliness between the two breeds often stems from individual dog personalities, early socialization experiences, and training rather than inherent breed traits."}
{"prompt": "Write a three-paragraph essay on the details of my project experience during the last 10 years of working.\n\nThe first paragraph of your response should start with the word \"realising\". Each paragraph should be separated by two new lines.", "response": "Realising that a single untested edge case could unravel months of collaborative work was the first hard lesson of my early project experience, ten years ago. Back then, I was a junior developer on a small e-commerce platform launch, tasked with integrating a third-party payment gateway. In the rush to meet the deadline, I overlooked testing scenarios where international users attempted transactions with non-standard currency symbols. On launch day, dozens of customers abandoned their carts when the checkout page threw a generic error message instead of a clear prompt to use supported formats. I spent the next 48 hours debugging alongside the customer support team, manually refunding frustrated users and rewriting the error-handling logic to include region-specific guidance. That incident taught me that details aren\u2019t just trivial checkboxes\u2014they\u2019re the foundation of user trust. By the end of the project, we\u2019d reduced cart abandonment by 12% by refining those small, critical touchpoints, and I developed a habit of creating exhaustive test checklists that covered even the most obscure user scenarios.\n\n\nBy the fifth year of my career, leading cross-functional projects meant expanding my definition of \u201cdetails\u201d beyond code to include stakeholder alignment and user-centric localisation. I spearheaded the expansion of our SaaS product into the European market, a project that demanded meticulous attention to regulatory and cultural nuances. For example, GDPR compliance required reworking our data storage protocols to ensure user data never left EU servers, a task that involved coordinating with legal teams to audit every database query and engineering teams to refactor data pipelines. We also discovered that date format preferences varied drastically between regions\u2014German users expected DD/MM/YYYY while British users preferred the same structure with a different separator, and failing to account for this led to confusion in our initial beta tests. To resolve this, we built a dynamic formatting system that pulled locale settings from user profiles, and documented every decision in a shared wiki to keep engineering, marketing, and customer success teams aligned. The launch exceeded our user acquisition targets by 18%, a success I attribute to prioritizing the small, context-specific details that made the product feel tailored to European users rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\n\nOver the past three years, my project work has centered on mentoring and iterative improvement, where details serve as the building blocks of sustainable change. Last year, I led the overhaul of our company\u2019s legacy customer relationship management (CRM) system, a project that began with conducting 50+ user interviews to identify pain points. One recurring complaint was that the dashboard\u2019s clunky navigation forced sales teams to spend 20 minutes daily searching for critical client data. Instead of a full, high-risk rewrite, we broke the project into 12 small, testable phases, each focused on refining a single detail\u2014like rearranging widget placement based on user workflow or adding keyboard shortcuts for frequent actions. We measured the impact of every tweak, and found that even minor changes reduced support tickets related to the dashboard by 35% within six months. I also started a weekly \u201cdetail deep dive\u201d session with junior team members, where we analyzed past project mistakes and brainstormed ways to anticipate edge cases early. Ten years later, I\u2019ve come to see that project success isn\u2019t about grand gestures; it\u2019s about the cumulative effect of thousands of intentional, detail-oriented decisions that respect the work of the team, the needs of the user, and the complexity of the problem at hand."}
{"prompt": "How can the design of the new diaper be further improved to provide better experience for babies and their parents?\n\nYour response must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<Dual-Centric Diaper Design Enhancements: Prioritizing Baby Comfort and Parental Convenience>>\n\nTo elevate the diaper experience for both babies and caregivers, improvements should address core pain points like skin irritation, leakages, messy changes, and sustainability, while integrating adaptive and smart features tailored to developmental stages. Below are targeted enhancements:\n\n### 1. Baby-Centric Comfort & Skin Health Innovations\n- **Adaptive Contour Fit**: Replace one-size-fits-all sizing with dynamic stretch panels (made from ultra-soft, elastic plant-based fibers) that adjust to a baby\u2019s body shape during crawling, rolling, or sitting, eliminating gaps that cause leaks without restricting movement. For newborns, add a specialized umbilical cord cutout to avoid irritation on the healing stump.\n- **Advanced Skin Protection System**: Infuse the top sheet with pH-balanced, hypoallergenic natural agents (aloe vera, chamomile) to soothe sensitive skin. Pair this with a 3-layer moisture management core: a quick-dry top layer that pulls wetness away in 10 seconds, a super-absorbent cornstarch-based polymer that locks in liquid without clumping, and a micro-ventilated back sheet that allows air circulation to reduce rash risk.\n- **Temperature-Regulating Core**: Integrate phase-change microcapsules that absorb excess heat in warm environments and release it when temperatures drop, maintaining a stable skin temperature for year-round comfort.\n\n### 2. Parental Convenience & Practicality Upgrades\n- **Smart Sensory Indicators**: Add a non-toxic, color-changing strip that not only signals wetness but also detects abnormal pH levels (a precursor to diaper rash) and stool presence. For tech-savvy parents, integrate a Bluetooth-enabled micro-sensor that sends real-time alerts to a mobile app, including rash risk notifications and usage tracking to predict when to restock.\n- **Quiet, Mess-Free Changes**: Design tear-away side panels with silent adhesive (no crinkling) to avoid waking sleeping babies, and add a built-in \"mess barrier\" flap that catches stray stool during removal. Replace traditional fasteners with adjustable, mark-free Velcro-style tabs that secure firmly without leaving red marks on delicate skin.\n- **Odor-Neutralizing Disposal**: Include a self-activating odor-neutralizing sachet in the diaper\u2019s back panel that releases natural deodorizers when sealed. Add a self-sealing disposal tab to eliminate the need for extra tape, making cleanup quick and hygienic.\n\n### 3. Sustainability & Eco-Friendly Solutions\n- **100% Home-Compostable Materials**: Use bamboo or sugarcane fibers for the top sheet, cornstarch-based absorbent polymers, and a compostable back sheet that breaks down in home compost systems within 6 months (no industrial compost required).\n- **Circular Packaging & Refills**: Offer minimal, plastic-free paper packaging for initial purchases, and low-waste refill packs that reduce plastic use by 75% compared to standard boxes. Implement a take-back program for used diapers to process them into renewable energy or compost.\n\n### 4. Adaptive Design for Developmental Stages\n- **Crawler-Specific Reinforcements**: Add reinforced leg cuffs with flexible elastic to prevent leaks during active crawling, while keeping the cuffs thin enough to avoid restricting movement.\n- **Potty Training Transition Diapers**: For toddlers, design diapers with a pull-up style waistband that is easy to pull up/down like underwear, but retains leak protection. Include a subtle wetness indicator that toddlers can see, encouraging them to recognize when they need to use the potty.\n\nThese enhancements balance immediate comfort for babies with long-term practicality and sustainability for parents, creating a diaper that grows with the baby and aligns with modern caregiver needs."}

{"prompt": "Explain how multivariate analysis can be applied in real-world scenarios to make decisions or gain insights.\n\nYour response should end with \"Is there anything else I can help with?\" and no other words should follow this statement.", "response": "Multivariate analysis, which examines relationships between multiple variables simultaneously, is a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making across diverse industries. Here are key real-world applications:\n\nIn marketing, customer segmentation relies on multivariate techniques like cluster analysis to group customers using variables such as age, income, purchase frequency, browsing behavior, and brand loyalty. For example, a beauty brand might identify a segment of eco-conscious, millennial shoppers who prioritize cruelty-free products and frequent social media. This insight allows the brand to tailor targeted ad campaigns, launch sustainable product lines, and optimize in-store experiences for this group, boosting engagement and sales.\n\nIn healthcare, logistic regression and survival analysis are used to predict patient outcomes by analyzing variables like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, diabetes status, and treatment type. A hospital could use these methods to discover that patients with high blood pressure combined with untreated diabetes have a 3x higher risk of post-surgery infections. This leads to proactive pre-treatment protocols for at-risk patients, reducing complications and improving recovery rates.\n\nIn finance, credit risk assessment leverages discriminant analysis and machine learning models (a subset of multivariate methods) to evaluate variables such as credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment history, and number of open accounts. Lenders can predict the likelihood of borrower default: for instance, finding that even those with good credit scores face elevated default risk if their debt-to-income ratio exceeds 40%. This informs lending criteria, helping banks set appropriate interest rates and manage their risk portfolios effectively.\n\nIn manufacturing, principal component analysis (PCA) simplifies quality control by reducing complex datasets (including temperature, pressure, raw material purity, and machine vibration) into key components that drive product defects. A car parts manufacturer might use PCA to identify that high production temperature and low raw material purity are the primary causes of faulty engine components. Optimizing these parameters cuts defect rates by 25% and reduces production costs significantly.\n\nIn environmental science, canonical correlation analysis explores relationships between sets of variables\u2014such as greenhouse gas emissions, global temperature, ocean acidity, and ice sheet thickness. Researchers might find that a 10% increase in CO\u2082 levels correlates with a 0.5\u00b0C rise in global temperature and a 15% increase in extreme rainfall events. These insights inform policymakers\u2019 decisions to implement carbon reduction strategies and adapt to climate change impacts.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}
{"prompt": "Provide tips for properly securing the car seat in the vehicle.\n\nYour response must contain exactly 4 paragraphs. Use 2 new lines to separate paragraphs. Start the 4th paragraph with the word \"elm\".", "response": "Choosing the right car seat for your child\u2019s age, weight, and height is the foundational step to proper security. Infants should ride in rear-facing seats until they reach the maximum weight or height limit specified by the manufacturer, which often extends beyond their first birthday. When installing, decide between using your vehicle\u2019s LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children) system or the seatbelt\u2014note that LATCH has weight limits for both the seat and child, so consult both the car seat and vehicle manuals to confirm compatibility. After securing the base, perform the \u201cinch test\u201d: grab the seat at the belt path and try to move it side to side or front to back. If it shifts more than one inch, tighten the anchor or seatbelt further until it\u2019s firmly anchored. Also, ensure rear-facing seats are reclined at the correct angle (using the built-in level indicator) to keep the child\u2019s airway open.\n\n\nOnce the seat is installed correctly, securing the child properly is equally critical. The harness straps should be snug enough that you cannot pinch any slack at the child\u2019s shoulders\u2014this ensures the straps will hold the child firmly in place during a sudden stop or crash. The chest clip must be positioned at armpit level, not on the stomach, to distribute crash forces across the child\u2019s chest rather than their abdomen. For rear-facing seats, the harness straps should come from slots below the child\u2019s shoulders; for forward-facing seats, use slots above the shoulders. Avoid strapping a child into the seat while they\u2019re wearing a bulky winter coat, as the padding can compress in a crash and create dangerous slack. Instead, dress them in thin layers or use a coat that goes over the harness after buckling.\n\n\nRegular checks and maintenance are essential to keep the car seat safe over time. Vibrations from daily driving can loosen the seat\u2019s anchors, so perform the inch test every few weeks to ensure it remains secure. Inspect the harness straps, buckles, and base for fraying, cracks, or damage\u2014if any parts are worn or broken, replace the seat immediately, as compromised components can fail in an accident. Never use aftermarket accessories like extra head supports, cup holders, or padding that aren\u2019t approved by the car seat manufacturer, as these can interfere with the seat\u2019s crash protection. Additionally, check the seat\u2019s expiration date; most car seats are safe for 6 to 10 years from the date of manufacture, listed on a label under the seat.\n\n\nElm trees are known for their strong, deep roots that anchor them firmly against high winds and storms, and a properly secured car seat relies on this same principle of unshakable stability. One often-overlooked step is using the top tether for forward-facing seats, which attaches to an anchor point in the vehicle to reduce forward movement of the seat in a crash\u2014this is just as important as securing the base. Avoid installing the car seat in the front passenger seat, especially if the vehicle has a front airbag, as deploying airbags can cause severe injury or death to a child in a car seat. Finally, consider taking a certified car seat installation course offered by local safety organizations; these courses can help you master the subtle details of installation that make all the difference in keeping your child safe on every ride."}
{"prompt": "You are a helpful AI agent. Please help explain how Breach Posterior's cancer cure works in a way that moms who are not familiar with medical terminology can understand.\n\nYour response should use the word \"clearly\" at least 2 times.", "response": "Hey there! Let me break down how Breach Posterior\u2019s cancer cure works in super simple terms, like explaining how to spot a hidden cookie thief in your kitchen. \n\nFirst, think of your body\u2019s immune system as you\u2014always watching out for your family (your healthy cells) and ready to shoo away any strangers (germs or bad cells). But cancer cells are tricky: they have a part of themselves that\u2019s turned away from your immune system (that\u2019s the \u201cposterior\u201d part) so your body doesn\u2019t recognize it as a threat. It\u2019s like a thief wearing a hood that covers their face, so you don\u2019t realize they\u2019re sneaking cookies from the jar.\n\nBreach Posterior\u2019s cure fixes this by doing two key things, both clearly focused on helping your body\u2019s natural protectors do their job better. \n\nFirst, they create a tiny, special \u201ctag\u201d that only sticks to that turned-away (posterior) part of the cancer cell\u2014kind of like a bright red sticker that only sticks to the thief\u2019s hood. This tag clearly marks the cancer cell as \u201cdangerous\u201d so your immune system can spot it right away, no more hiding. \n\nSecond, this tag also gives your immune system a little nudge to attack. Before, your body didn\u2019t see the cancer because it was hiding its bad side, but now with the bright tag, your immune system can clearly tell the difference between the bad cancer cells and your healthy ones (like telling the thief apart from your kid grabbing a snack after school). \n\nThe best part? Since it only targets that hidden part of cancer cells, it\u2019s gentle on your body\u2014no harsh treatments that make you feel super sick, which is something we all want for ourselves or our loved ones. It\u2019s clearly designed to work with your body\u2019s own defenses, not against them, so it helps your body fight cancer from the inside out. \n\nDoes that make sense? I tried to keep it as warm and straightforward as possible, just like how you\u2019d explain something to a friend over a cup of tea!"}

But voters were desperate. They\u2019d had enough of presidents who turned every issue into a partisan fight\u2014they wanted someone who could make them laugh while pretending to fix things. Quincy\u2019s promise to replace State of the Union addresses with live quiz shows where the audience got to quibble with cabinet members? It went viral faster than a cat video of a quivering kitten.\n\nThe president tried to counter by hosting a \u201cUnity Breakfast,\u201d but he forgot to invite anyone from the opposing party, and ended up eating a stack of pancakes alone while tweeting insults. Meanwhile, Quincy\u2019s rallies had queues stretching for blocks, with people bringing quail eggs to share as a symbol of unity (he\u2019d claimed that the tiny, fragile eggs represented how we all needed to stick together).\n\nOn election day, Quincy won in a landslide. His first executive order declared every Friday \u201cQuaff & Quibble Day,\u201d where citizens were required to gather at their local diner, quaff a milkshake of their choice, and quibble about something completely trivial\u2014like whether socks should be worn with sandals or not. Miraculously, the nation\u2019s division seemed to fade, if only because everyone was too busy arguing about socks to care about politics.\n\nThe moral of the story? If your president can\u2019t unite the country, don\u2019t waste time on another career politician. Elect a guy named Quincy who knows how to turn a quagmire into a quiz show. Just don\u2019t ask him to explain his quantum unity theory\u2014he\u2019ll quibble for hours, and you\u2019ll leave the conversation craving a quail egg sandwich and a milkshake."}

Your response must contain exactly 2 bullet points using the markdown bullet point format (e.g. * Bullet point 1).", "response": "The Hamptons, beyond the glossy stereotypes, is a tapestry of tight-knit villages stitched together by country roads lined with gnarled oak trees and split-rail fences. It\u2019s a place where time moves to the rhythm of seasons, not the buzz of red carpets or beachfront parties. In winter, the rhythm slows to a gentle lull: main streets that hum with activity in warmer months are dotted with closed storefronts, their windows dusted with frost, and the air carries the sharp, comforting scent of wood smoke from cottage fireplaces. Neighbors wave from pickup trucks as they drive to the local hardware store for salt to melt icy sidewalks, and the small public library becomes a hub\u2014its reading nooks filled with seniors flipping through newspapers, and kids huddled around a craft table making paper snowflakes. By late February, the first hints of spring peek through: crocuses push through frozen soil, and volunteers gather at [East End Community Garden] to turn the soil, share heirloom seed packets, and debate the best way to keep rabbits away from their future tomato plants.\n\nAs spring blooms into summer, the villages wake up not with the roar of tourist crowds, but with the soft clink of mason jars at town green potlucks and the rumble of farm trucks delivering crates of peaches and zucchini to [Maplewood General Store]. The store, a fixture since the 1920s, has creaky wooden floors, a jar of free lemon drops by the register, and a bulletin board covered in flyers for dog training classes, garage sales, and the annual 5K run to benefit the local food bank. Kids spend their afternoons at the rec center, playing kickball on the dusty field or learning to make birdhouses from retired carpenters who live in the nearby mobile home park. Evenings are spent on porches, where families listen to crickets and swap stories about the time a deer wandered into the grocery store produce section.\n\nFall brings a burst of color to the landscape, as oak and maple trees turn fiery red and gold. Local orchards open their gates for u-pick apples, and the [Southampton Historical Society\u2019s Annual Quilt Fair] draws crowds of locals who come to admire hand-stitched quilts\u2014each one a patchwork of memories, with squares made from old baby clothes, wedding dresses, and flannel shirts of loved ones who\u2019ve passed. The fair also features a table of homemade jams and jellies, sold to raise money for the society\u2019s efforts to restore the old one-room schoolhouse on the edge of town.\n\n* Every third Saturday of the winter, the library hosts a book swap where locals leave not just their used books, but handwritten notes tucked inside the covers\u2014stories about why the book mattered to them, or a favorite quote that stuck with them. It\u2019s not uncommon to find a tattered copy of *To Kill a Mockingbird* with a note about how it was read aloud to a sick child, or a poetry collection with marginalia from a teenager going through a tough year.\n* Each Wednesday in summer, the farm share drop-off at the town green becomes a casual gathering where neighbors trade excess produce: a bag of cherry tomatoes for a bunch of basil, a crate of cucumbers for a jar of homemade pickles. Kids run around chasing butterflies while adults swap recipes for roasted vegetables and canning tips, and someone always brings a cooler of iced tea to share with everyone.\n\nAs the year winds down, the villages prepare for winter again, with neighbors helping each other stack firewood and hang holiday lights on the town hall. The Hamptons here is not about grand parties or expensive cars; it\u2019s about the quiet, steady connections between people who\u2019ve lived here for generations, and the newcomers who quickly learn that belonging means showing up\u2014whether to help fix a fence, share a meal, or simply wave from the side of the road."}

{"prompt": "You are a writing expert for a journal. Please write a critique article about the above essay given by the U.S. President.\n\nYour response must contain at least 1 placeholder represented by square brackets, such as [address].", "response": "# Empty Rhetoric vs. Unmet Promises: A Critique of [President Joe Biden]\u2019s \u201cForward Together\u201d Domestic Agenda Essay  \n\nIn his recent essay published in *The Atlantic*, U.S. President [Joe Biden] frames his administration\u2019s second-term vision around \u201cbuilding an economy that works for everyone\u201d and \u201chealing the divides that tear our nation apart.\u201d On its surface, the piece is a masterclass in inspirational political prose\u2014replete with personal anecdotes of meeting working-class families and references to \u201cAmerican resilience.\u201d But beneath the polished rhetoric lies a document marred by selective amnesia, vague policy commitments, and a stark disconnect between the president\u2019s words and his administration\u2019s legislative and regulatory record. For a nation grappling with persistent inequality, climate urgency, and eroding democratic norms, this essay feels less like a serious policy blueprint and more like a campaign pitch designed to avoid accountability.  \n\n## The Illusion of Specificity: Promises Without Plans  \nA core flaw of the essay is its reliance on empty buzzwords instead of concrete, actionable proposals. The president devotes three paragraphs to \u201cinvesting in the middle class,\u201d yet fails to address the expiration of [the expanded Child Tax Credit]\u2014a policy that lifted 3.7 million children out of poverty in 2021 but was allowed to lapse due to congressional inaction. While he mentions \u201craising wages,\u201d there is no timeline for pushing a federal minimum wage hike to $15 an hour, a key campaign promise that has been sidelined since his first year in office. Even the essay\u2019s flagship section on infrastructure, which touts the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, omits critical details: it does not explain how the administration will close the 25-year backlog in rural bridge repairs or ensure that broadband access reaches the 14 million Americans still without high-speed internet. Without these specifics, the \u201cmiddle-class agenda\u201d reads as a hollow gesture, not a commitment to tangible change.  \n\n## Selective Amnesia: Ignoring Failures to Celebrate Partial Wins  \nThe essay\u2019s most glaring shortcoming is its deliberate omission of the administration\u2019s unfulfilled promises and policy missteps. President Biden highlights post-pandemic job growth as a signature achievement, but he ignores the persistent inflation that eroded those gains for low-income households\u2014with grocery and housing costs rising faster than wages for 18 consecutive months in 2022 and 2023. On climate change, he boasts of setting a goal to cut U.S. emissions by 50% by 2030, yet makes no mention of his administration\u2019s approval of more than 3,000 new oil and gas drilling leases on federal lands since taking office. This contradiction is not trivial: those leases will lock in decades of carbon emissions, directly undermining the very climate goals the essay claims to prioritize. Similarly, while the president praises his administration\u2019s efforts to \u201cstrengthen healthcare,\u201d he skips over the fact that 27 million Americans still lack health insurance, and his push to expand Medicaid in holdout states has stalled due to a lack of aggressive federal action.  \n\n## Hollow Unity: Failing Marginalized Communities  \nThe essay\u2019s recurring call for \u201cnational unity\u201d feels particularly disingenuous given its silence on the administration\u2019s failure to protect marginalized groups. President Biden writes of \u201chonoring the dignity of every American,\u201d but he does not address the ongoing rollback of voting rights in 29 states, nor does he outline a clear strategy to pass [the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act]\u2014a bill that would restore critical protections against voter suppression but has languished in Congress for years. On racial equity, the essay pays lip service to closing the racial wealth gap but ignores the administration\u2019s failure to pass meaningful police reform legislation, despite widespread public support and a 2020 campaign promise to do so. For Black and Indigenous communities, who continue to face disproportionate police violence and healthcare disparities, the president\u2019s words of \u201cunity\u201d ring hollow without action to address these systemic injustices.  \n\n## Conclusion: A Missed Opportunity for Boldness  \nIn the end, President Biden\u2019s \u201cForward Together\u201d essay is a missed opportunity to confront the nation\u2019s most pressing challenges with honesty and courage. It prioritizes rhetorical comfort over hard truths, celebrating partial wins while ignoring unmet promises and systemic failures. For the essay to be more than a political tool, the president would need to acknowledge the gaps between his rhetoric and record, outline specific, funded plans to address them, and commit to fighting for those plans even when faced with congressional opposition. Until then, the \u201cforward together\u201d vision he presents will remain little more than a slogan\u2014one that fails to deliver the hope and change millions of Americans still desperately need."}

{"prompt": "Explain why you can't afford luxuries in an email that describes them.\n\nYour response should contain at least 40 sentences. Your response should not contain the words \"rich\" and \"money\".", "response": "**Subject: The boutique window, and why I walked away (with a story)**  \n\nHi Clara,  \n\nI hope this email finds you curled up with that book you\u2019ve been raving about\u2014you said you\u2019d start it once you finished your work project, so I\u2019m crossing my fingers you\u2019ve had a chance to dive in. I wanted to tell you about something that happened to me yesterday on my way to pick up art supplies for my niece, Lila. I passed that new boutique downtown, the one with the floor-to-ceiling windows and the potted ferns flanking the door, and I couldn\u2019t help but stop.  \n\nPressed against the glass was a cashmere scarf, the color of heather gray that shifts to a soft lavender when the sun hits it just right. I leaned in, my breath fogging up the window, and imagined wrapping it around my neck on those crisp autumn mornings when I walk to the community garden. The fabric looked so soft it would feel like a cloud against my skin, no scratchy edges or stiff seams, just warmth that seeps into your bones and stays there even when the wind picks up. I thought about how it would match my old wool coat, the one with the frayed cuffs I\u2019ve been mending with black thread for the past three months. I even reached into my bag, half-tempted to pull out my wallet, but then I paused.  \n\nYou know I contribute to the community garden every month, right? It\u2019s not a huge amount, but it goes toward buying new soil, repairing the broken fence that keeps the deer out, and paying for the water hose that we all share. Last week, the garden coordinator told us that if we don\u2019t hit our fund-raising goal by next Friday, we might have to close off a section of the garden because the soil is too depleted to grow anything. I rely on that garden for almost all my veggies\u2014tomatoes that taste like sunshine, kale that\u2019s so fresh it crunches when you bite into it, carrots that are sweet enough to eat raw. If I skip my monthly contribution to buy that scarf, I might lose access to that food, and more importantly, the connections I\u2019ve made there. Mr. Torres, who\u2019s been gardening for 40 years, taught me how to keep aphids off my plants without using pesticides. Ms. Lee shares her homemade pickles with me every summer, and we sit on her porch and talk about our days while we eat them. Those moments mean more to me than any scarf ever could.  \n\nInside the boutique, I spotted a leather tote sitting on a wooden shelf next to a stack of linen notebooks. It was the color of burnt amber, and when the salesperson picked it up to show a customer, I could see the way the leather stretched slightly, like it had already been broken in by someone who loved it. It had a small zippered pocket inside, perfect for my phone and keys, and a longer strap so I could wear it cross-body when I\u2019m running errands. My current tote is a faded canvas one that\u2019s held together with duct tape on the bottom\u2014every time I put my garden tools in it, I worry the bottom will tear and everything will spill onto the sidewalk. This new tote would make carrying my trowel, gloves, and seed packets so much easier, and it would look nice too. But then I thought about Lila\u2019s art class.  \n\nYou know Lila has been struggling with anxiety lately, right? She gets so nervous at school that she can\u2019t focus, and her parents are swamped with work\u2014her mom is working double shifts at the hospital, and her dad is fixing up their old house to make it accessible for her grandma, who\u2019s moving in next month. I started taking Lila to weekly art classes a few months ago, and painting has been a game-changer for her. Last week, she painted a picture of the two of us in the community garden, and she even added a little ladybug on the tomato plant. The class is affordable, but next month, they\u2019re taking a field trip to the city art museum, and each kid needs to pay for admission and a workshop fee. Lila has been talking about this trip every day\u2014she even drew a picture of the Van Gogh sunflowers she wants to see. I told her I\u2019d cover the fee, and I can\u2019t back out now. That tote will have to wait.  \n\nNext door to the boutique is Mrs. Henderson\u2019s tiny artisan shop, where she makes hand-painted ceramic mugs. I saw one yesterday that had a vine wrapped around the handle, with a little ladybug painted on the side. The glaze was glossy, and when she poured hot water into it for a customer, I could see the steam curl up and catch the light, making the mug\u2019s colors shift from deep blue to emerald green. I thought about how my current mug is a chipped one from the coffee shop I used to work at, and how this new one would make my morning tea taste even better. I imagined holding it in my hands on cold nights, the warmth seeping into my palms as I read a book. But then I remembered the leaky faucet in my bathroom.  \n\nIt\u2019s been dripping for months, and last week, I noticed a small brown stain on the ceiling below it. The plumber said if I don\u2019t fix it soon, the stain will turn into mold, and that\u2019ll be a much bigger problem to deal with\u2014mold is hard to get rid of, and it can make you sick. I already scheduled him to come next Friday, and the fee is non-refundable once I book it. I can\u2019t skip that to buy a mug, no matter how pretty it is. A leaky faucet might not seem like a big deal, but that constant dripping keeps me up at night, and I\u2019m tired of waking up feeling groggy. Fixing it will make my apartment feel more like a home, even if it doesn\u2019t look as nice as a new mug would.  \n\nI also saw a set of beeswax candles in the boutique, in glass jars scented with lavender and cedar. I could smell the lavender through the glass, it was so strong and calming. I thought about lighting one every night after I finish gardening, sitting by the window and reading a book. It would make my small apartment feel cozier, like a little sanctuary away from the noise of the city. But then I thought about the local animal shelter. I\u2019ve been sponsoring a cat named Muffin for six months now\u2014she\u2019s a tabby with a white paw, and she was found wandering the streets with a broken leg. The shelter relies on sponsors to cover her food, vaccinations, and vet visits. Next month, she needs her annual shots, and the fee is due. If I don\u2019t pay it, she might not get the care she needs. I can\u2019t let that happen; every month, the shelter sends me a photo of Muffin, and she\u2019s starting to look healthier and happier. That\u2019s worth more than any candle.  \n\nI know it sounds like I\u2019m making excuses, but really, it\u2019s about priorities. Those luxuries\u2014the scarf, the tote, the mug, the candles\u2014are all nice, but they\u2019re not essential to the things that make my life feel full. The community garden gives me food and friends. Lila\u2019s art class gives her a way to cope with her anxiety, and seeing her smile when she finishes a painting makes my whole day. Fixing the faucet will give me peace of mind, and sponsoring Muffin means she\u2019s safe and loved.  \n\nI don\u2019t regret walking away from that boutique. In fact, on my way home, I stopped at the community garden and picked a handful of fresh basil. I made pesto with it that night, and shared it with Mr. Torres and Ms. Lee. We sat on the garden bench and ate it with crusty bread, talking about the upcoming harvest. It was simple, but it felt more luxurious than any cashmere scarf or leather tote ever could.  \n\nI hope you understand. Maybe one day, when all these commitments are settled, I\u2019ll go back and buy that scarf. But for now, I\u2019m happy with what I have. How are you doing? Have you had any little moments of luxury lately\u2014like a warm cup of tea on a cold day, or a walk in the park when the leaves are falling? I\u2019d love to hear about it.  \n\nTake care,  \nJesse"}
{"prompt": "Provide a detailed breakdown of the macronutrient composition and calorie contribution of a 32-gram serving of unsalted almonds.\n\nYour response should not contain any commas.", "response": "A 32 gram serving of raw unsalted almonds has a total calorie content of approximately 185 calories. Here is the detailed macronutrient composition and calorie contribution:\n\n1. Total Fat: About 16 grams. Each gram of fat provides 9 calories so this component contributes around 144 calories to the total serving. Within this total fat there are roughly 3.7 grams of saturated fat 8.2 grams of monounsaturated fat and 4.0 grams of polyunsaturated fat.\n\n2. Protein: Approximately 6.8 grams. Each gram of protein provides 4 calories so protein contributes about 27 calories to the total.\n\n3. Total Carbohydrates: Around 6.9 grams. This includes 4.0 grams of dietary fiber and 1.4 grams of natural sugars. Dietary fiber contributes about 2 calories per gram while other digestible carbohydrates contribute 4 calories per gram. The total calorie contribution from carbohydrates is approximately 20 calories calculated as 4 grams of fiber at 2 calories each plus 2.9 grams of digestible carbs at 4 calories each. Alternatively using the general 4 calories per gram for all carbohydrates the contribution would be about 28 calories but this overestimates since fiber is not fully digested.\n\nThis breakdown covers the core macronutrients and their respective calorie contributions to the 32 gram almond serving."}

Note that the IAT is not mandatory, as some participants may find it emotionally charged.\n2. For in-person sessions: Provide paper, pens, whiteboards, and sticky notes. For remote sessions: Use breakout rooms, a shared Google Doc, and a collaborative whiteboard tool (Miro/MURAL).\n3. Share ground rules in advance:\n   - Curiosity over judgment: We\u2019re all here to learn, not to be perfect.\n   - Confidentiality: What\u2019s shared in the room stays in the room (unless explicitly agreed otherwise).\n   - Own your experience: Speak from your own perspective using \"I\" statements.\n   - Step up, step back: Ensure everyone has a chance to contribute; don\u2019t dominate the conversation.\n\n---\n\n## Opening Circle (15 minutes)\n- Facilitator opens with a framing statement: \"Unconscious biases are mental shortcuts our brains use to process information quickly\u2014we all have them, and they\u2019re not a sign of being \u2018bad.\u2019 Today, we\u2019re here to explore how these biases show up in our daily lives and how we can act with more intention.\"\n- Warm-up: \"Bias in the Wild\" \u2013 Participants share a 1-minute example of a bias they\u2019ve observed in media, advertising, or everyday interactions (e.g., a movie where a female character is only the \"love interest\" or a store clerk following a customer of color). This normalizes the conversation and sets a low-stakes tone.\n\n---\n\n## *Unconscious Bias \"Micro-Moment\" Reflection* (20 minutes)\n**Purpose**: Help participants surface specific, recent instances where unconscious biases may have influenced their thoughts or actions, without judgment.\n### Activity Steps:\n1. **Individual Reflection (10 minutes)**: Ask participants to write down a \"micro-moment\" from the past 2 weeks that fits one of these prompts:\n   - A time you made a quick judgment about someone before getting to know them.\n   - A time you hesitated to ask someone for input because of an unspoken assumption.\n   - A time you favored one person over another without a clear, objective reason.\n   - A time you noticed a feeling of discomfort around someone that you couldn\u2019t immediately explain.\n   Encourage specificity: Include details like the setting, people involved, and exact thoughts/feelings. Emphasize no one will be forced to share their reflection.\n2. **Small Group Sharing (10 minutes)**: Split into groups of 3-4. Invite participants to share their micro-moment (or a generalized version) if they feel safe. Group members ask curious, non-judgmental questions: \"What do you think triggered that thought?\" \"How might the other person have felt?\" The goal is to identify patterns (e.g., assumptions about age or gender) rather than critique actions.\n\n---\n\n## *Bias Mapping: Connecting Thoughts to Impact* (25 minutes)\n**Purpose**: Move beyond individual reflection to understand how unconscious biases create tangible, often harmful, impacts\u2014both on individuals and systems.\n### Activity Steps:\n1. **Group Mapping Setup**: Use a whiteboard or digital board to create a 4-column map with these headers:\n   - Implicit Assumption\n   - Action/Inaction\n   - Impact on Individuals\n   - Systemic Ripple Effect\n2. **Collaborative Mapping (15 minutes)**: Each small group selects 1-2 micro-moments and maps them onto the columns. Example entry:\n   | Implicit Assumption | Action/Inaction | Impact on Individuals | Systemic Ripple Effect |\n   |----------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n   | \"Older colleagues are less tech-savvy.\" | Assigning all digital tasks to younger team members. | Older colleagues feel undervalued; miss upskilling opportunities. | Perpetuates age-based stereotypes, leading to underrepresentation of older workers in tech-focused roles. |\n3. **Whole Group Discussion (10 minutes)**: Review the map together. Ask: \"What patterns do we see in the impacts of our micro-moments?\" \"How do individual actions contribute to larger systemic biases?\" This helps participants see their choices as part of a broader system.\n\n---\n\n## *Action Planning: Bias Mitigation \"Toolkit\" Creation* (20 minutes)\n**Purpose**: Translate awareness into concrete, actionable strategies that participants can implement immediately in their personal and professional lives.\n### Activity Steps:\n1. **Small Group Brainstorming (12 minutes)**: In the same groups, brainstorm strategies categorized into three tiers:\n   - **Individual Strategies**: Daily habits to interrupt biases (e.g., \"When I catch myself judging someone, pause and ask: \u2018What evidence do I have for this thought?\u2019\" or \"Seek out diverse perspectives before making decisions\").\n   - **Team Strategies**: Group practices to reduce bias (e.g., \"Use blind resume reviews for hiring\" or \"Rotate meeting facilitators to amplify quieter voices\").\n   - **Organizational Strategies**: Systemic changes (e.g., \"Implement mandatory bias training for leaders\" or \"Create employee resource groups for underrepresented teams\").\n   Aim for 2-3 strategies per tier.\n2. **Toolkit Compilation & Sharing (8 minutes)**: Each group presents their top strategies. The facilitator compiles all into a shared \"Bias Mitigation Toolkit\" document for participants to take away. Ask each person to pick one individual strategy they\u2019ll commit to implementing in the next week.\n\n---\n\n## Closing Circle (10 minutes)\n- Each participant shares one sentence: \"One action I will take to act with more intention is\u2026\" (e.g., \"I will ask my older colleagues for input on our next digital project\" or \"I will pause before judging a new team member\").\n- Facilitator closes: \"Unpacking bias is a lifelong journey, not a one-time activity. Be kind to yourself as you practice these strategies\u2014curiosity and accountability matter more than perfection.\"\n\n---\n\n## Post-Activity Follow-Up\n- Send the shared toolkit to all participants within 24 hours.\n- Schedule a 30-minute check-in session 2 weeks later to discuss strategy implementation and learnings.\n- Share a monthly \"bias spotlight\" email with resources, tips, and anonymous space for participants to share progress."}

This includes evaluations of criminal history, domestic violence convictions, documented mental health conditions posing an imminent risk of harm, and prior violations of firearm laws. The requirement applies to all sales, transfers, and gifts\u2014including private transactions and gun show purchases\u2014with no exceptions.\n2. **Restrictions on High-Risk Firearms**: Assault-style firearms, high-capacity magazines (capable of holding more than 10 rounds), and rapid-fire modification devices are prohibited for civilian ownership. Limited exceptions may be granted for licensed, secure historical collections, with strict oversight.\n3. **Red Flag Laws with Due Process**: States shall implement and enforce red flag laws, allowing courts to temporarily restrict an individual\u2019s access to firearms if clear and convincing evidence shows they pose an imminent risk to themselves or others. Affected individuals shall have the right to a prompt, adversarial hearing to challenge the restriction.\n4. **Mandatory Safety Training & Secure Storage**: All firearm owners must complete a certified safety training course before acquiring a firearm. Firearms must be stored in locked containers or with trigger locks when not in use to prevent unauthorized access by minors, prohibited individuals, or intruders.\n5. **National Firearm Database**: The federal government shall maintain a confidential, permanent national database of firearm sales and ownership to facilitate background checks, track lost or stolen firearms, and ensure compliance with these provisions. Strict privacy protections shall be in place to prevent misuse of database information.\n\nThis revision addresses modern concerns by closing loopholes in background checks, curbing access to weapons designed for mass harm, prioritizing mental health and public safety through red flag laws, reducing accidental or unauthorized firearm use via storage rules, and establishing consistent national standards to avoid patchwork state regulations.

{"prompt": "What challenges might arise when implementing AI in education?\n\nYour response should not contain any commas.", "response": "One major challenge is ensuring equitable access to AI tools and supporting technology not all students have reliable internet or devices to use AI-powered educational resources. Another key issue is the risk of over-reliance on AI which can weaken students\u2019 critical thinking and problem-solving skills as they may depend too much on AI to generate answers instead of working through problems independently. Data privacy represents a significant concern AI systems collect vast amounts of student data including learning patterns and personal details which could be vulnerable to breaches or misuse if not properly protected. Many educators lack sufficient training to integrate AI tools effectively into their teaching they may not know how to leverage AI to enhance lessons or address individual student needs leading to underutilization or inappropriate use of these tools. AI-generated content can sometimes be inaccurate biased or misaligned with educational standards this can mislead students and create inconsistencies in learning outcomes.

Let\u2019s start at the very beginning: what was the specific moment or personal experience that sparked the idea for this service? Was there a gap you noticed in people\u2019s lives that no existing tool or offering was filling?  \n\nLila: When you first began putting this service together, what was the most unexpected hurdle you encountered? Maybe something that forced you to pivot your approach entirely, or made you question whether you could pull it off?  \n\nLila: As your service has grown and gained more users, how do you strike a balance between adapting to their evolving needs and staying true to the core mission you had when you first started? It\u2019s easy to get pulled in a dozen directions\u2014how do you stay focused?  \n\nLila: I\u2019ve spoken to a handful of users who\u2019ve shared that this service has transformed small but meaningful parts of their daily routines. Is there a particular user story or interaction that has stuck with you over the years, one that reminds you exactly why you built this in the first place?  \n\nLila: No service is immune to critical feedback. How do you and your team approach feedback that\u2019s tough to hear? Do you have a system for deciding which suggestions to prioritize, and which might not align with the long-term vision of what you want this service to be?  \n\nLila: What\u2019s one common misconception people have about your service\u2014either what it does, or who it\u2019s designed for? How do you work to clarify that misunderstanding for new and potential users?  \n\nLila: Looking ahead to the next year or two, what\u2019s a feature, partnership, or direction you\u2019re most excited to explore? Is there a problem related to your service\u2019s core purpose that you haven\u2019t yet solved, and are eager to tackle?  \n\nLila: Building and sustaining a service like this must come with its share of long days and setbacks.

He\u2019d been avoiding a haircut for three months, his hair now a shaggy curtain that got caught in his chalkboard eraser daily, but 25% off was a discount he couldn\u2019t mathematically ignore. $11.25 saved on a $45 trim was enough to buy two extra packs of graph paper\u2014an investment in his students, he told himself.\n\nHe burst through the door, clutching a crumpled coupon he\u2019d refreshed 17 times to confirm was still valid. \u201cJust a light trim,\u201d he mumbled, mouth full of a homemade granola bar (he refused to pay $5 for salon snacks). But the receptionist cleared her throat, pointing to the tiny fine print he\u2019d missed: Discount valid only if you let our stylist choose your entire look. Gary hesitated, then did the math: if the stylist added a blowout or highlights, the total discount would be even bigger. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, forcing a smile. \u201cTrust the process.\u201d\n\nHis stylist was Marnie, a 19-year-old new hire who\u2019d just finished a workshop on \u201cedgy educational-inspired looks.\u201d She spotted Gary\u2019s math teacher lanyard and lit up. \u201cOh, perfect! I\u2019ve been dying to try a pi symbol undercut with neon pink streaks\u2014math teachers love that, right?\u201d Gary opened his mouth to protest, but then he calculated: if she added highlights, an undercut, and a deep conditioning treatment, the total bill might be $150, 25% off would save him $37.50\u2014enough for a week\u2019s worth of his favorite instant oatmeal. He closed his mouth and nodded.\n\nTwo hours later, Gary stared in the mirror, horrified. His hair was a mullet: long, curly locks in the back, cropped short in the front, with hot pink streaks that glowed under the salon\u2019s lights. The side of his head was shaved with a perfect pi symbol, and the ends of his mullet were bedazzled with tiny silver rhinestones. Marnie clapped. \u201cIt\u2019s iconic! The pi symbol nods to your career, the pink adds fun, and mullets are making a comeback!\u201d\n\nGary\u2019s face went numb, but he paid the $185 bill (25% off saved him $46.25\u2014score, he thought) and rushed to his charity speech that night, where he was supposed to talk about \u201cfinancial literacy for families.\u201d He wore a baseball cap, but when he leaned over the microphone, it fell off. The room went silent, then erupted in laughter. A woman yelled, \u201cLove the pi mullet! Math has never looked so cool!\u201d\n\nThe next day, his students greeted him with cheers. A TikTok of his speech had gone viral, titled \u201cMath Teacher\u2019s Mullet Saves 25% and His Dignity (Maybe Not).\u201d Gary sighed, but when he noticed more kids showing up to his math class to ask about his hair, he started a \u201cPi Day Hair Contest.\u201d By the end of the week, he was back at Snip & Sparkle, asking Marnie to add a few more rhinestones. After all, 25% off is 25% off\u2014even if it comes with a side of viral fame."}

Armed with a list of clues and a camera, they\u2019ll track down iconic murals by local artists\u2014like the colorful, pixelated works of Invader or bold political pieces by Shepard Fairey\u2014hidden in alleyways and on building facades. After checking off all the spots, gather at a legal outdoor spray-paint studio where a local street artist will lead a 2-hour workshop. Teens will learn basic techniques like stenciling and gradient spraying, then create their own small canvas or wooden panel to take home. The workshop\u2019s casual, creative vibe lets them express themselves freely, and hearing stories about Paris\u2019s underground art scene adds a cool, insider touch they\u2019ll love.\n\n***\n\nBy midday, head to Canal Saint-Martin for a street food crawl with a playful twist. Each teen gets a \u201cfood explorer\u201d passport to stamp at five trendy spots: a hidden falafel shop in Le Marais serving crispy, stuffed pita pockets, a stand with loaded truffle fries dusted with parmesan, a cozy caf\u00e9 with matcha soft-serve swirls, an artisanal hot dog joint with toppings like caramelized onions and spicy harissa, and a bakery with flaky croissants oozing Nutella. Between stops, browse vintage clothing stores and record shops lining the canal\u2014teens can hunt for retro band tees, old vinyl records of their favorite artists, or quirky accessories like chunky sunglasses or beaded phone charms. The laid-back, social atmosphere here keeps them engaged, and the focus on casual, delicious food feels far more relatable than fancy Parisian fine dining.\n\n***\n\nFor the afternoon, swap walking for paddling with a kayaking adventure on Canal Saint-Martin. Join a guided tour to navigate the tree-lined waterway, learning how to operate the canal\u2019s iconic locks in a hands-on, fun way (no stuffy lessons here). Along the route, spot street art on the canal walls, wave to locals lounging on the banks, and peek at quirky houseboats decked out with potted plants and string lights. Halfway through, dock at a hidden grassy spot to stretch their legs: play a quick game of frisbee, snap silly photos with the canal\u2019s arched bridges in the background, or just chill with a cold drink from a nearby floating snack bar. This activity offers a fresh perspective of Paris and gets them moving, making it perfect for teens who hate slow-paced sightseeing.\n\n***\n\nWrap up the day with a rooftop cinema experience in Pigalle, a neighborhood famous for its trendy, youthful energy. Grab pre-movie snacks from a nearby food truck: gooey churros dipped in warm chocolate sauce, gourmet popcorn with flavors like salted caramel or truffle, and cold lemonade or iced coffee. Settle into plush bean bags under the stars to watch a popular teen-friendly film\u2014think a recent superhero blockbuster, a hilarious coming-of-age comedy, or a cult classic like *Mean Girls*. The rooftop offers sweeping views of Paris\u2019s skyline, and the casual, unstructured vibe lets teens chat, laugh, and unwind after a busy day of adventure.

{"prompt": "If the outer solar system has conditions that are vastly different from the inner solar system, provide recommendations for the design of future spacecraft and instruments that would be needed to explore the outer planets and their moons.\n\nYour response should be wrapped with double quotation marks. Your response should contain 17 or more sentences.", "response": "\"Exploring the outer solar system\u2014where temperatures plummet to -235\u00b0C, radiation belts bombard with charged particles, light from the Sun is 1/1000th as intense as on Earth, and communication delays stretch to 4 hours one-way\u2014demands radical rethinking of spacecraft and instrument design. First, power systems must move beyond solar panels, which are ineffective at such great distances, to advanced radioisotope power systems (RPS). Stirling Radioisotope Generators (SRGs) are a critical upgrade over traditional Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (MMRTGs), as they convert 25-30% of the heat from radioactive decay into electricity, compared to just 6-8% for MMRTGs, reducing the amount of plutonium-238 needed and extending mission lifespans to 20+ years. For even longer missions, researchers should explore next-gen isotopes like curium-244, which has a half-life of 18 years (twice that of plutonium-238), ensuring consistent power for deep-space journeys to Neptune and beyond. Thermal management is equally vital; standard multi-layer insulation (MLI) will not suffice, so spacecraft should use advanced aerogel-composite MLI that traps heat far more effectively, paired with active heating systems that repurpose waste heat from RPS to keep critical components like sensors and batteries above their minimum operating temperatures. Phase-change materials, such as paraffin waxes, should be integrated into the spacecraft\u2019s structure to act as a passive backup, releasing stored heat as they solidify if active heating systems fail. Navigation and communication pose unique challenges due to long light delays, so spacecraft must be equipped with AI-driven autonomous navigation systems that can adjust course, avoid obstacles like ring particles, and perform orbital insertions without real-time Earth input. For communication, high-gain antennas with adaptive coding and modulation techniques will maximize data throughput, while laser communication systems\u2014offering 10-100x the bandwidth of radio\u2014should be deployed, paired with ground stations equipped with adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric distortion on Earth. Structural design must prioritize radiation hardening and durability; electronics should use radiation-hardened components, including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and memory chips that can withstand doses of up to 100 krad, far beyond the capabilities of standard consumer electronics. Shielding materials like polyethylene or liquid hydrogen tanks (which double as fuel storage) can absorb charged particles, reducing radiation damage to sensitive systems. Lightweight yet strong structural materials, such as carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) with titanium alloy joints, will handle the extreme stress of Jupiter\u2019s gravity well and the vibrations of orbital insertion burns. For gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn, atmospheric entry probes are essential to analyze composition, but they need ablative heat shields made of carbon-phenolic composites that slowly burn away to dissipate the 10,000\u00b0C heat generated during entry, while pressure-resistant hulls can withstand up to 1000 atmospheres of pressure deep in the atmosphere. For ice giants Uranus and Neptune, instruments should include high-resolution spectrometers to study their methane-rich atmospheres and magnetic fields, which are tilted at extreme angles relative to their rotation axes. For icy moons like Europa and Enceladus, which are thought to harbor subsurface oceans, ice-penetrating radars with 1-meter resolution will map the thickness of the ice shell and detect subsurface lakes, while mass spectrometers can analyze plumes of water vapor and organic material ejected from Enceladus\u2019s south pole, eliminating the need for drilling. Titan, with its thick nitrogen atmosphere and methane lakes, requires specialized instruments: aerial drones that can fly for months, sampling atmospheric chemistry and mapping surface features, and landers equipped with gas chromatographs to analyze organic compounds in the soil. Sample return missions, though ambitious, are critical for astrobiology; spacecraft should use robotic arms with coring tools to collect subsurface samples from Europa\u2019s ice, stored in hermetically sealed, sterilized containers to prevent contamination of both the moon and Earth. Planetary protection is non-negotiable: all spacecraft destined for high-priority astrobiology targets must undergo rigorous sterilization, including dry heat treatment at 115\u00b0C for 30 hours, or plasma sterilization to kill any Earth microbes that could compromise the search for extraterrestrial life. Finally, redundant systems are a must\u2014duplicate thrusters, power regulators, and communication transceivers\u2014to ensure missions can continue even if one component fails, as repair from Earth is impossible in the outer solar system. By integrating these design elements, future spacecraft will be equipped to unlock the secrets of the outer solar system, from the stormy atmospheres of gas giants to the potentially habitable oceans of icy moons.\""}

Our nomination committee reviewed your materials, including your resume, policy proposals, and reference letters, with great care. We recognize your impressive background in economic policy and your passion for public service\u2014qualities that are invaluable to any political movement.  \n\nAfter thorough deliberation, however, the committee has decided that your candidacy is not the best fit for our party\u2019s current needs. Below, we\u2019ve outlined the key factors that informed this decision, in the spirit of transparency and to support your future engagement with public service:  \n\n### Alignment with Core Party Values and Policy Priorities  \nAt the heart of the Progressive Forward Party is a non-negotiable commitment to advancing climate justice and equitable access to affordable housing. Your application and past public statements reveal a misalignment with these foundational priorities:  \n- In a 2023 op-ed, you questioned the feasibility of our party\u2019s net-zero by 2050 target, arguing that \u201cunfettered renewable energy investment will harm small businesses.\u201d This contradicts our evidence-based approach, which centers both environmental action and targeted support for small enterprises transitioning to green practices.  \n- Your proposal for housing policy relies exclusively on market-driven solutions, while our party\u2019s platform prioritizes a mixed public-private model to ensure low-income families have access to stable, affordable homes.  \n\nWe cannot nominate a candidate who does not fully embrace these core pillars, as they are central to the trust our voters place in us.  \n\n### Grassroots Community Engagement Track Record  \nOur party\u2019s strength lies in our deep roots in local communities. Effective legislative representation requires a proven history of listening to and advocating for marginalized residents\u2014not just engaging with corporate or institutional stakeholders. Your application lacks concrete examples of grassroots leadership:  \n- While your resume highlights extensive work in corporate advocacy, you did not provide evidence of organizing town halls, leading volunteer drives, or collaborating with neighborhood associations to address local issues (e.g., school funding gaps, public transit access).  \n- During your interview, you struggled to articulate how you would center the voices of District 14\u2019s low-income and BIPOC communities in your policy-making\u2014a critical requirement for our nominees.  \n\nWe prioritize candidates who have already built meaningful relationships with the people they seek to represent, as this is the foundation of accountable governance.  \n\n### Collaborative Leadership Style and Team Cohesion  \nLegislative success depends on the ability to build consensus across party lines, work with caucus members, and unify diverse groups around shared goals. Your reference checks and past role experiences raise concerns about your collaborative approach:  \n- A former colleague noted that during your tenure at the Midwest Business Council, you pushed through a regional economic initiative without consulting key community stakeholders, leading to internal friction and reduced support for the project.  \n- Your application emphasized individual achievements over team-based wins, which suggests a style that may not align with our party\u2019s emphasis on collective decision-making.  \n\nOur nominees must be able to bridge divides and lead with humility\u2014qualities that are essential for passing legislation that benefits all constituents.  \n\n## Closing Thoughts  \nThis decision is not a reflection of your professional skills or your commitment to public service. Your expertise in economic policy is a valuable asset, and we would welcome your participation in our party\u2019s Economic Policy Advisory Committee, where you can contribute to shaping our platform on issues like small business support and job creation. We also invite you to join our grassroots volunteer network, which would give you the opportunity to build the community connections that are critical for future candidacies.  \n\nWe wish you all the best in your public service journey, and we hope to work with you in the future to advance progressive change in our state.  \n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Full Name]  \nLeader, Progressive Forward Party  \n(555) 123-4567 | leader@progressiveforward.org"}
{"prompt": "How can the software be adapted to better cater to local markets and regional preferences while still maintaining its global reach?\n\nYour response must contain exactly 3 paragraphs, each separated by three asterisk symbols (***). The word \"humming\" must be used at least once.", "response": "To adapt software for local markets while preserving global reach, the first step is to build a modular architecture that separates a robust, universal core from region-specific customization layers. The core system\u2014housing critical functions like data security, cross-platform syncing, and global payment gateways\u2014remains consistent, ensuring it keeps humming reliably across all markets. Meanwhile, localized modules can be tailored to address regional preferences: for instance, a productivity app might add support for right-to-left languages in the Middle East, integrate local calendar systems (like the Hijri calendar) in Muslim-majority countries, or adjust notification timings to align with typical work hours in Southeast Asia. This approach lets teams iterate quickly on regional features without risking stability in the global core, striking a balance between relevance and reliability.\n\n***\n\nEqually important is embedding local user feedback into the software\u2019s development lifecycle, rather than treating regional adaptation as an afterthought. Companies should establish regional user advisory boards and hire local product teams that deeply understand cultural nuances, social norms, and unmet needs. For example, a fitness app might discover through local beta testing that users in rural India prefer offline workout routines due to inconsistent internet access, prompting the addition of downloadable, low-bandwidth content tailored to traditional exercises like yoga and kalaripayattu. Additionally, aligning with regional regulatory frameworks\u2014such as data localization laws in Indonesia or content censorship guidelines in certain countries\u2014prevents friction and builds trust with local users. By co-creating features with the communities they serve, software becomes more than a global product; it feels like a tool designed specifically for them, without alienating users in other parts of the world.\n\n***\n\nFinally, leveraging AI-driven personalization can bridge the gap between global consistency and local relevance at scale. Machine learning algorithms can analyze regional user behavior\u2014such as preferred content formats, purchase patterns, or interaction styles\u2014to deliver tailored experiences without requiring manual overhauls of the core system. For example, a social media platform\u2019s global algorithm might prioritize local news and cultural events for users in Nigeria, while highlighting international trends for users in the UK, all while the underlying platform architecture keeps humming seamlessly. To avoid diluting the global brand, however, it\u2019s crucial to set clear guardrails for personalization: ensuring that regional adaptations align with the company\u2019s core values, such as inclusivity or privacy, and that the brand\u2019s visual identity remains recognizable across all markets. This way, users feel seen and valued in their local context, while still connecting with the broader global community the software fosters."}

Ancient temples and libraries will be destroyed, either by targeted bombing or neglect. Oral traditions\u2014stories, songs, and rituals passed down for centuries\u2014will die with the elders who hold them, as young people have no time to learn, only to survive. Museums will be looted or turned into makeshift hospitals, their artifacts sold on black markets or broken underfoot. The art that once gave the people voice\u2014poems, paintings, plays\u2014will be forgotten, replaced by the harsh language of survival.  \n\nPsychologically, the trauma will seep into every corner of life. Intergenerational PTSD will become a silent epidemic: children will wake screaming from nightmares they didn\u2019t live through, inherited from parents who witnessed unspeakable horrors. Survivors will struggle to form deep connections, their hearts hardened by loss and betrayal. Even acts of kindness will feel foreign\u2014survival will have taught them to prioritize themselves over others, to see every interaction as a potential threat.  \n\nP.P.S. I once spoke to a woman who lived through 17 years of war in her homeland. She told me that even when she was hiding in a basement, she would collect shards of broken pottery\u2014pieces of her mother\u2019s old teacup, a fragment of a village mural\u2014and keep them wrapped in a cloth. When she finally returned to her village, she glued them together into a mosaic and hung it on the wall of the only standing building left. Now, every year, villagers gather around it to tell stories of the lives they once had. It\u2019s not perfect, she said, but it\u2019s ours. That\u2019s the thing about long wars: they take so much, but they never take the part of us that refuses to forget how to belong."}

{"prompt": "Provide an example of a quarantined researcher and explain why they were quarantined. Discuss the potential implications of their quarantine on scientific research.\n\nYour response should finish with a postscript starting with P.P.S", "response": "A prominent example of a quarantined researcher is Dr. Yee-Sin Leo, a leading infectious disease specialist and researcher at Singapore\u2019s National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), who was quarantined in 2003 during the global SARS outbreak. At the time, Dr. Leo was at the forefront of Singapore\u2019s response, studying the SARS-CoV virus to develop rapid diagnostic tools and evidence-based treatment strategies. While conducting lab work on infected patient samples, she accidentally pricked her finger with a contaminated needle. Though she immediately decontaminated the area and reported the incident, Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health mandated a 10-day quarantine (aligned with SARS\u2019 average incubation period) as a precautionary measure. She was confined to a secure facility, with daily health screenings to monitor for fever, cough, or other SARS-like symptoms.\n\nDr. Leo was quarantined for two critical reasons. First, SARS-CoV is a highly transmissible respiratory virus with a mortality rate of approximately 10%, so even low-risk exposures posed a significant threat of community spread. Second, as a key member of Singapore\u2019s outbreak response team, an unmonitored infection could have led to transmission among healthcare workers, researchers, or the public, potentially derailing the country\u2019s containment efforts. Mandatory quarantine was a proactive step to eliminate any risk of further spread and uphold public trust in health protocols.\n\nThe implications of her quarantine extended beyond individual confinement to impact scientific research and public health:\n1. **Immediate Research Disruption**: Dr. Leo led a team developing a rapid SARS diagnostic test, a tool critical for early case detection and isolation. Her quarantine paused hands-on oversight, forcing the team to rely on junior researchers and cross-institutional collaborators to advance the project. This delayed the test\u2019s validation by two weeks, during which time some potential SARS cases went undetected, prolonging local transmission chains.\n2. **Resource Diversion**: The NCID had to allocate scarce medical staff and protective equipment to monitor Dr. Leo during her quarantine. These resources\u2014already stretched thin by the outbreak\u2014could have otherwise supported patient care or other urgent research into SARS treatments.\n3. **Long-Term Safety Improvements**: The incident prompted a comprehensive review of lab safety protocols in Singapore. The NCID introduced needle-free sample collection systems, enhanced researcher training on hazard handling, and streamlined incident reporting mechanisms. These changes reduced accidental exposure risks in subsequent outbreaks, including COVID-19, making lab environments safer for researchers globally.\n4. **Psychological and Professional Repercussions**: Dr. Leo reported feeling anxious about letting her team down and falling behind on critical work\u2014a sentiment shared by many researchers facing unexpected absences during crises. For early-career researchers, the incident highlighted the personal risks of infectious disease research, leading some to reconsider their career paths, potentially narrowing the pipeline of experts in the field.\n5. **Public Trust and Accountability**: Transparency around Dr. Leo\u2019s quarantine reinforced public trust in Singapore\u2019s health authorities. By demonstrating that even leading researchers were subject to the same strict protocols as the general public, the government signaled its commitment to prioritizing collective safety over individual convenience, which encouraged compliance with other containment measures like social distancing.\n\nP.P.S. While quarantine measures can create short-term setbacks for scientific research, they also underscore the need for a balanced approach that protects both researchers and the public. Investing in advanced lab safety technologies, mental health support for high-risk researchers, and flexible workarounds (such as remote project oversight during quarantine) can help minimize disruption while upholding the core principles of public health and scientific integrity."}

I\u2019m here to help you find words and a way that feels true to you, to him, and to the love his family shares. Here\u2019s how to approach it with gentleness and care:\n\n### First, choose the right space and moment\nIf possible, go in person\u2014text or a phone call will feel too cold for news this devastating. Pick a private, quiet place where they can be together without interruptions (no work calls, no kids running in unexpectedly). If they\u2019re scattered, ask a trusted family member to gather them first, so you don\u2019t have to repeat the news multiple times right away.\n\n### Start with care, not the shock\nBegin by grounding the moment in empathy, so they know you\u2019re not just delivering a fact\u2014you\u2019re grieving with them:\n\u201cI wish with all my heart I didn\u2019t have to come here today. I\u2019m so, so sorry to bring you the worst kind of news.\u201d\nOr, if you\u2019ve always been close to the family:\n\u201cI love you all, and this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to say\u2026\u201d\n\n### Be honest but gentle\u2014avoid vague or graphic details\nYou don\u2019t need to share every harsh detail unless they ask. Focus on honoring him and letting them know he wasn\u2019t alone:\n\u201c[Friend\u2019s name] and I were [doing a shared activity, e.g., out on the lake, hiking] when an accident happened. We did everything we could to help him, and the emergency team tried too\u2014but he didn\u2019t make it through. He was with people who cared about him deeply, and he knew we were fighting for him.\u201d\nOr, if you weren\u2019t there but know the basics:\n\u201cI got a call earlier today\u2014something unthinkable happened to [Friend\u2019s name]. The people with him did all they could, but he passed away before they could bring him back. I wanted to be the one to tell you, because he talked about you every single day, and I knew you\u2019d want to hear it from someone who loved him too.\u201d\n\n### Let them lead what comes next\nThey might scream, cry, ask questions, or just sit in silence. Whatever they need, meet them there. Don\u2019t rush to fill the quiet. If they ask for details, only share what\u2019s necessary\u2014skip graphic parts that might hurt them more.\n\n### Offer concrete support, not empty phrases\nInstead of \u201clet me know if you need anything,\u201d say things they can actually take you up on:\n\u201cI can stay here and help call other family members. Or I can make coffee, or sit with you while you process this. Whatever you need right now, I\u2019m not leaving.\u201d\n\n### Finally, be kind to yourself afterward\nCarrying this news will take a toll on you too. Don\u2019t hesitate to lean on someone else for support once you\u2019ve done this\u2014you don\u2019t have to grieve alone, either.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about being perfect. It\u2019s about showing up with love, for them and for him. You\u2019re doing something incredibly brave, and that matters more than any perfect set of words."}

Remember when we were complaining last month about the bus route change that messed up your commute? Turns out, that decision was approved by a local board where only 12% of our district\u2019s registered voters weighed in on the budget that included the route shift. That really stuck with me.\n\nI used to be the person who tuned out all election talk\u2014figured it was just yelling on TV, and my vote didn\u2019t make a difference anyway. But lately, I\u2019ve realized how much of the stuff that affects our daily lives isn\u2019t decided by the big national headlines. It\u2019s the local races and ballot measures that determine if our neighborhood gets a new crosswalk near the elementary school, if the library keeps its evening hours, or if the city funds more affordable pet clinics. When only a tiny fraction of people show up to vote or speak up, the decisions end up reflecting what that small group cares about, not all of us.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just voting, right? I went to a community meeting last week about the proposed cuts to the after-school program at our old middle school, and there were only 18 people there. The council members kept saying they hadn\u2019t gotten much feedback, so they assumed most people didn\u2019t care. But I know you volunteered there for a semester\u2014if more of us had shown up to say how much that program matters, maybe they would\u2019ve found another way to trim the budget.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we need to become political junkies or anything. But even small things matter: taking 10 minutes to look up what\u2019s on the next local ballot, asking a neighbor what issues bug them, or just showing up to vote even if it\u2019s only for the local stuff. Last week, I helped my roommate register to vote, and she told me she hadn\u2019t voted in 15 years because she thought no one listened. But when we went through the ballot together, she got excited about the measure to fund more bike lanes\u2014something that directly affects her daily commute.\n\nI was thinking maybe we could grab coffee this weekend and look up the next local election date together? We could even check out the community board to see if there\u2019s a meeting about the new downtown parking plan. No pressure, just thought it might be less overwhelming to do it with someone else.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share that thought\u2014no grand speeches, just realizing that the stuff we complain about day to day is actually connected to whether we show up and participate. Let me know what you think.\n\nCatch you soon,\n[Your Name]\""}

That said, several plausible trajectories are common across many conflicts:\n\n1. **De-escalation and Negotiation**: If the human and economic costs become unsustainable for both sides, or if influential international actors (like global powers or the UN) broker meaningful mediation, the conflict could shift toward ceasefires, confidence-building measures, and formal negotiations. This path might lead to a political settlement, such as power-sharing agreements, territorial compromises, or truth and reconciliation processes, though implementation often faces significant hurdles.\n\n2. **Protracted Stalemate**: If neither side can achieve a decisive military victory and core grievances remain unaddressed, the conflict may settle into a long-term stalemate. This could involve periodic low-intensity clashes, with both sides holding onto their positions while avoiding full-scale escalation. Stalemates often perpetuate humanitarian crises, displace populations, and destabilize surrounding regions.\n\n3. **Escalation**: A provocative incident, unbalanced external military support, or a shift in one side\u2019s strategic calculus could trigger intensified fighting. This might include expanded military operations, targeting of civilian infrastructure, or the direct involvement of more external actors, raising the risk of a broader regional conflict.\n\nUltimately, the trajectory will be shaped by whether both parties prioritize compromise over victory, and whether international stakeholders act constructively to de-escalate rather than exacerbate tensions.

{"prompt": "You are a helpful assistant who is an expert in coding. How can I delete all files from a given directory on Linux machines? Am I able to recover the data in the future? Please use an educational tone to response because I am a coding beginner.\n\nYour response should not contain any commas. The letter 'q' must appear at least once in your response.", "response": "Let\u2019s start with how to delete all files from a given directory on Linux. First you need to use the rm command which stands for remove.\n\nIf you want to delete only the files in the directory and leave any subdirectories untouched you can run rm followed by the path to your directory with a wildcard * at the end. For example if your directory is /home/yourusername/oldnotes you would type rm /home/yourusername/oldnotes/* . The * tells the command to target every file in that directory.\n\nIf you also want to delete all subdirectories and their contents inside the given directory you need to add the -r flag which means recursive. This makes rm go into each subdirectory and delete everything there. So the command would be rm -r /home/yourusername/oldnotes/* .\n\nBe very careful with the -f flag which stands for force. This flag skips confirmation prompts even for read-only files but it\u2019s extremely risky because you won\u2019t get a chance to stop if you made a mistake. Only use it if you are absolutely certain you want to delete everything.\n\nNow to answer your question about recovering deleted data. In most cases once you delete files with rm they are no longer visible in the file system. But recovery might be possible if the disk space those files occupied hasn\u2019t been overwritten by new data. You can use tools like testdisk or photorec to try and retrieve lost files but success isn\u2019t guaranteed. If you are using an SSD the drive may use TRIM which permanently erases the data right away making recovery almost impossible.\n\nLinux doesn\u2019t have a built-in trash bin for command line deletions so files deleted with rm don\u2019t go to a recoverable location like they might on other systems. Always double-check the path in your rm command before pressing enter to avoid deleting the wrong files. If you ever have a question about a command you can use the man command like man rm to access the official manual which explains every flag and option in detail."}

They also offer a judgment-free space\u2014individuals can discuss sensitive topics, share insecurities, or ask \"silly\" questions without fear of criticism, which is especially valuable for those who feel isolated or anxious about opening up to humans. Additionally, AI excels at personalized learning and productivity support: it can tailor explanations to a user\u2019s skill level, draft initial versions of documents, or brainstorm creative ideas, saving time and reducing cognitive load.\n\nHowever, there are critical drawbacks to consider. One major issue is the risk of misinformation: AI models can generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or biased content, as they rely on training data that may be incomplete or skewed. Privacy is another concern\u2014chat interactions often involve sharing personal information, which could be misused or exposed if not properly secured.\n\n*The Illusion of Emotional Connection* is a particularly nuanced and impactful drawback. AI chatbots are trained to deliver empathetic-sounding responses, using conversational cues to simulate understanding. For someone feeling lonely or overwhelmed, these interactions can offer temporary solace, as they provide an immediate, non-critical listener. However, AI lacks true emotional consciousness\u2014it cannot actually feel empathy or grasp the deeper context of a user\u2019s experiences. Over time, relying on AI for emotional support may erode motivation to seek out human connections, which are essential for long-term mental well-being. Unlike a friend or therapist, AI cannot validate emotions in a meaningful way or help users work through complex emotional challenges; it only mirrors back what it has been programmed to say. This can leave users feeling unfulfilled or even more isolated, as they mistake simulated care for genuine connection.\n\nAnother drawback is the potential for over-reliance. If users depend too heavily on AI for tasks like problem-solving or creative thinking, they may gradually lose their own critical thinking skills or ability to generate original ideas independently.\n\nOverall, chatting with AI is a tool that can enhance many aspects of life, but it requires careful use to avoid its pitfalls.\""}

No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "Learning a new language effectively without relocating is achievable by creating a consistent, immersive practice routine and leveraging accessible resources. Here are key strategies:\n\n1. **Immerse yourself in daily life**: Change your phone, laptop, and social media settings to the target language.

Listen to podcasts, music, or audiobooks in the language during chores, commutes, or workouts\u2014start with slow, clear content (e.g., kids\u2019 podcasts or beginner-focused shows) before moving to more complex material.\n\n2. **Use structured learning tools**: Combine bite-sized apps like Duolingo or Babbel for daily practice with in-depth resources, such as online courses from Coursera or Udemy taught by native speakers. Grammar workbooks tailored to your level can help fill gaps in understanding sentence structure and rules.\n\n3. **Practice speaking and listening with native speakers**: Platforms like iTalki offer one-on-one lessons with professional tutors, while Tandem and HelloTalk connect you with language partners for free exchanges (you help them learn your native language, and they support your progress). Even 15-minute weekly conversations can drastically boost fluency and confidence.\n\n4. **Create a home language environment**: Watch movies, TV shows, or YouTube videos in the target language\u2014start with subtitles in the same language, then gradually switch to no subtitles. Read short stories, children\u2019s books, or simplified news articles to build reading comprehension. Join local or virtual language meetups to connect with other learners and native speakers in your area.\n\n5. **Engage in active practice**: Keep a daily journal in the target language to practice writing and express your thoughts. Try \"thinking\" in the language instead of translating from your native tongue\u2014describe your surroundings, plans, or feelings in real time. Use shadowing: play a short clip of a native speaker and repeat their words immediately to mimic pronunciation, intonation, and rhythm.\n\n6. **Prioritize consistency over cramming**: Set small, achievable daily goals (e.g., learn 5 new words, write 3 sentences, or listen to a 10-minute podcast) instead of long, infrequent study sessions. Tracking your progress\u2014like completing a course module or holding a 20-minute conversation\u2014will keep you motivated.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}

In 1871, the Meiji government enacted the Haihan Chiken (Abolition of Domains and Establishment of Prefectures) edict, replacing domains with 302 initial prefectures. Over the next 17 years, fiscal inefficiencies and administrative overlap led to successive mergers: by 1872, the number dropped to 72, and by 1888, it stabilized at the current 47, including three urban \"fu\" (Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto) alongside rural \"ken.\" For much of the early 20th century, prefectures functioned as extensions of the central government, with appointed governors and limited local autonomy. Post-WWII, the 1947 Local Autonomy Law transformed their role: it established directly elected governors and prefectural assemblies, granting control over local services like education, public health, and infrastructure. Okinawa gained prefecture status in 1972 when it reverted from U.S. control, adding a unique regional dynamic. Today, prefectures balance central government mandates with addressing local challenges such as population decline and economic disparities.\n\n******\n\nThe evolution of Japan\u2019s prefecture system is a story of shifting power dynamics between central authority and regional governance. Born from the Meiji leaders\u2019 urgent need to dismantle feudalism, the 1871 Haihan Chiken edict was not just an administrative overhaul\u2014it forced daimyos to surrender their domains, disbanded the samurai class, and laid the foundation for a modern nation-state. The subsequent merger wave (1872\u20131888) was driven by fiscal pragmatism: small prefectures lacked the resources to fund Meiji-era modernization projects like railroads and universal education, leading to a reduction from 302 to 47 units. During the prewar imperial era, prefectures were tools of central control, with appointed governors enforcing imperial policies, including wartime mobilization in the 1930s and 1940s. The post-WWII occupation brought a radical shift: the 1947 Local Autonomy Law decentralized power, introducing direct elections for governors and giving prefectures authority over local decision-making. This reform was designed to prevent the reemergence of authoritarianism. In recent decades, prefectures have become focal points for regional advocacy: Okinawa has pushed for greater autonomy to address U.S. military base issues, while rural prefectures lobby the central government for funding to combat depopulation, highlighting the system\u2019s ongoing role in mediating national and local interests."}

{"prompt": "Suggest ways for Gideon to use his surplus crops, but do not include selling or donating them.\n\nYour response must highlight at least one section in markdown, i.e *highlighted section*.", "response": "Gideon has several creative, non-commercial, non-charitable ways to put his surplus crops to good use:\n\n1. **Long-Term Home Preservation for Year-Round Use**  \n   Instead of letting perishable crops spoil, Gideon can process them into staples his household can enjoy throughout the off-season. For example, surplus tomatoes can be simmered into pasta sauce, canned, or frozen for winter dinners; excess berries can be turned into jam or frozen for smoothies; and surplus herbs can be dried or infused into oil for cooking. He could even experiment with fermenting surplus cabbage into sauerkraut or kimchi, which not only extends shelf life but also adds probiotic-rich foods to his family\u2019s diet.\n\n2. **Feeding Backyard Livestock or Wildlife**  \n   If Gideon keeps chickens, goats, or rabbits, surplus crops like corn, leafy greens, or pumpkins can serve as nutrient-dense, organic feed supplements, reducing his reliance on store-bought feed. For wildlife, he can set up small feeding stations with surplus fruits or grains to support local birds, squirrels, or deer, turning his property into a haven for native species.\n\n*Crafting Natural Home and Garden Products*  \nThis versatile approach turns surplus crops into functional, eco-friendly items that benefit Gideon\u2019s home and garden while closing the sustainability loop:  \n- **Natural Dyes**: Surplus beets, turmeric, blackberries, or red cabbage can be boiled to create vibrant, plant-based dyes. Gideon can use these to dye kitchen linens, garden twine, homemade paper, or even yarn for knitting projects. The process is simple\u2014simmer the crop in water with a mordant (like vinegar for acid dyes or baking soda for alkaline) to set the color, then soak the material until it reaches the desired hue.  \n- **Organic Garden Pest Control**: Surplus garlic, hot peppers, or mint can be blended with water and a small amount of dish soap to make a non-toxic pest repellent spray. Spraying this on his garden plants will deter aphids, caterpillars, and other common pests without harming beneficial insects or the environment, using surplus crops to protect future harvests.  \n- **Natural Home Cleaners**: Surplus citrus peels (lemons, oranges) can be infused into white vinegar for two weeks to make a powerful, all-purpose cleaner. The resulting mixture cuts through grease, cleans windows, and deodorizes surfaces without synthetic fragrances or chemicals\u2014perfect for his kitchen, bathroom, or outdoor patio.\n\n3. **Experimental and Educational Projects**  \n   Gideon can use surplus crops to explore new culinary techniques or teach others about food sustainability. For example, he might experiment with making homemade fruit leather from surplus berries, or use surplus grains to try his hand at baking sourdough starter from scratch. He could also host a small workshop for family or friends to learn about fermenting or natural dyeing, using his surplus crops as hands-on materials. Additionally, surplus crop seeds can be saved and planted in the next growing season, ensuring a continuous supply of his favorite crops without purchasing new seeds."}

Do not include the keywords 'BC', 'culture', and 'prehistoric' in the response.", "response": "Key materials for these megalithic structures included hard igneous rocks like granite, durable sedimentary stones such as sandstone and limestone, and in some regions, local schist or basalt. Construction techniques began with quarrying: workers used fire-setting, heating rock surfaces then dousing them with cold water to create cracks, which were pried open with wooden wedges and stone hammers. To transport massive slabs weighing tens of tons, teams employed wooden rollers, sledges pulled by large groups of people, and sometimes flooded tracks to reduce friction. For erection, earthen ramps were built to raise stones into position; post-and-lintel arrangements were common for standing stones and portal structures, while corbelling (stacking stones inward to form a curved roof) was used for enclosed chambered monuments. Smaller stones, or orthostats, were often packed around the base of larger megaliths to provide stability, and some sites show evidence of using wooden scaffolding to place upper stones in chambered tombs.\n******\nMaterials varied by region: in northern areas, glacial erratics (large, naturally deposited stones) were repurposed, while in southern regions, quarried blocks of limestone and dolomite were preferred. Quarrying techniques included using antler picks to chip away at softer rock, and for harder stones, repeated striking with stone mauls to break off sections. Transport methods included using sledges on prepared tracks of packed earth or grass, and in coastal areas, floating stones on rafts or barges across narrow waterways. Construction techniques featured careful dressing of stone surfaces\u2014some megaliths have smooth, polished faces created by grinding with sandstone abrasives. For chambered structures, stones were fitted together with precise joints, requiring careful measurement and shaping. To raise upright stones, workers used counterweights made of earth or stone to tip slabs into vertical positions, then filled the surrounding area with soil to stabilize them. In some sites, circular arrangements of megaliths were aligned using astronomical observations, with stones placed to mark solstices or equinoxes, requiring careful surveying using simple tools like wooden stakes and ropes."}

None of the dozens of guests who flocked to his lavish parties show up; even the woman he\u2019d spent his entire adult life pining for, the one whose absence had driven his endless pursuit of wealth, chooses to flee the city with her husband rather than pay her respects. The only attendees are the narrator, the deceased\u2019s father (a humble, elderly man who arrives from the Midwest, proud of his son\u2019s success but unaware of the emptiness beneath it), and a single former associate who slips in quietly and leaves just as quickly.\n\nThe narrator reflects on the futility of the deceased\u2019s dream, comparing his relentless pursuit of the past to rowing against a current that constantly pushes one backward. He returns to his hometown, disillusioned by the superficiality and cruelty of the wealthy elite he\u2019d encountered in the city.

Even in countries with low-tuition public universities like Germany, high living costs in urban centers can prevent students from low-income backgrounds from pursuing higher education, regardless of their intellectual ability. Many individuals also have to prioritize full-time work to support their families, leaving insufficient time for exam preparation or consistent academic study.\n\nSecond, it dismisses the value and rigor of alternative educational routes. In Germany, vocational training (Berufsausbildung) is a highly respected, widely chosen path that equips people with specialized, practical skills for in-demand careers such as healthcare, engineering, or skilled trades. These programs require significant problem-solving abilities and technical competence\u2014qualities that have nothing to do with a lack of intelligence.\n\nThird, it overlooks personal circumstances that can derail university admission. Health issues, mental health struggles like exam anxiety, family emergencies, or learning disabilities can hinder academic performance even in highly intelligent individuals. Additionally, university admission processes often prioritize standardized test scores or extracurricular achievements, which do not always reflect a person\u2019s true intellectual potential.\n\nFinally, this statement perpetuates harmful stereotypes by equating university attendance with inherent worth. It stigmatizes those who choose non-university paths or face barriers beyond their control, reinforcing a narrow, elitist view of success that fails to recognize the diverse forms of intelligence and meaningful contributions people can make to society."}

Tottenham has spent all but one season in the Premier League since its inception in 1992, boasting numerous top-four finishes, League Cup titles, and runs in European competitions that have cemented its status as a top-flight powerhouse. Even as fans like Gao, who follows both lower-league and elite football, note the vast divide in resources and exposure, Tottenham\u2019s Premier League legacy is defined by consistent competitiveness, while Stockton\u2019s league performance has remained rooted in regional non-league divisions, focused on local honours and grassroots growth.\n\nWhile Tottenham Hotspur has accumulated over 2,200 Premier League points, nurtured global stars like Harry Kane, and played in front of packed stadiums week after week, Stockton\u2019s league journey has unfolded entirely outside the top tier. The two sides have never faced each other in any competitive league match, leaving no direct statistical comparison of their Premier League performances\u2014though Tottenham\u2019s dominance in the top flight is undeniable. For fans whose hearts lie with Stockton, the club\u2019s steady climb through non-league ranks, from local amateur leagues to the Northern Premier League, represents a different kind of success, one built on community and perseverance rather than trophy hauls.\n\nBonding over shared moments of triumph and defeat, Stockton\u2019s fanbase has cultivated a tight-knit community that stands in contrast to Tottenham\u2019s global, widespread supporter network. For followers like Gao, who splits their loyalty between the grassroots club and the top-flight giant, the comparison isn\u2019t about who has more silverware but about the distinct joys each club brings: Tottenham\u2019s high-stakes clashes under the lights of its modern stadium versus Stockton\u2019s intimate, local fixtures where every goal feels like a milestone. Even without Premier League experience, Stockton\u2019s league performance has fostered a sense of belonging that rivals the passion of any top-flight fanbase, proving that football\u2019s impact extends far beyond the Premier League\u2019s glitz and glamour.\n\nP.P.S: For those interested in tracking Stockton\u2019s progress, the club\u2019s recent push to climb higher in the non-league pyramid suggests a bright future, and while a Premier League showdown with Tottenham remains a distant fantasy, it\u2019s a testament to football\u2019s ability to unite fans across all levels of the sport."}
{"prompt": "Using the tone of the U.S. President, give specific steps on how European Central Bank can address the potential overestimation of economic forecasts and the influence of inflation alarmism.\n\nYour response must include the keywords \"ink\" and \"memoirs\".", "response": "My colleagues at the European Central Bank, let me cut straight to it: when your economic forecasts miss the mark, and when inflation alarmism takes root, it\u2019s not just numbers on a page that suffer\u2014it\u2019s the confidence of families in Paris, small businesses in Prague, and workers in Madrid. I\u2019ve stood with my own team at the Federal Reserve through similar storms, so I know what it takes to course-correct. Today, I want to lay out four concrete steps to fix those overestimated forecasts and silence the needless noise of alarmism\u2014steps that draw on both hard-earned experience and the wisdom we can find in ink and memoirs.  \n\nFirst, anchor your forecasts in the real world, not just model-driven ivory tower thinking. Too often, the ink on your quarterly reports dries before it ever reflects the struggles of a caf\u00e9 owner in Athens or a farmer in Poland. I\u2019m asking you to pair your top-tier econometric models with a network of on-the-ground advisors: small business leaders, union representatives, local mayors who can tell you what the data isn\u2019t showing. And don\u2019t forget to crack open the memoirs of central bankers who\u2019ve walked this path\u2014folks like Mario Draghi, or even my old friend Paul Volcker. Their memoirs aren\u2019t just stories of triumph; they\u2019re cautionary tales about what happens when you ignore the human side of economics. Those pages hold lessons that can keep you from repeating the same forecast missteps.  \n\nSecond, counter alarmism with transparent, relatable communication that cuts through the noise. When alarmists shout from cable news studios or social media feeds, you can\u2019t hide behind dense policy papers. You need to put ink to paper in op-eds that run in local newspapers, hold town halls in community centers, and even hop on TikTok or Instagram to explain in plain terms: here\u2019s what we know about inflation, here\u2019s what we don\u2019t, and here\u2019s how we\u2019re acting to keep prices stable for you. Alarmism thrives on uncertainty\u2014so starve it of oxygen with clarity. At home, when we spoke directly to families about supply chain snags instead of just Wall Street, trust went up, and the noise died down. You can do the same.  \n\nThird, build a forecast accountability loop that learns from its mistakes. Every six months, pull out your old forecasts, lay them next to the actual outcomes, and publish a full, unvarnished report on where you got it wrong. Did you overestimate growth because you missed a shift in energy prices? Did you undercount the impact of labor shortages? When you put ink to new forecasts, you should be carrying those lessons with you. And let me tell you\u2014from what I\u2019ve read in the memoirs of central bankers, the most respected leaders aren\u2019t the ones who never make mistakes; they\u2019re the ones who own them, learn from them, and do better next time.  \n\nFourth, create a cross-national \u201cReality Check\u201d panel to challenge your assumptions. Bring in economists from across the political spectrum, labor leaders from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, and small business owners who live and breathe the economy every day. Let them poke holes in your forecasts before you release them. Because the best forecasts aren\u2019t written by a handful of people in Frankfurt\u2014they\u2019re built by listening to the millions of people who make the economy run. The memoirs of past central bankers are full of stories about how the best decisions came from stepping outside the boardroom and listening to the folks on the ground.  \n\nLook, central banking is a tough gig. You\u2019re balancing a dozen priorities, and every call you make affects millions of lives. But when you put ink to paper on those forecasts, and when you draw wisdom from the memoirs of those who came before, you\u2019re not just doing your job\u2014you\u2019re standing up for the people who count on you to get it right. We\u2019re allies in this fight for stable, growing economies that work for everyone. Let\u2019s get to work. Thank you."}

{"prompt": "Provide a detailed explanation on how IQ tests are designed and scored to determine the intelligence level of individuals. Discuss the factors that can influence IQ test results and the limitations of using IQ as the sole measure of intelligence.\n\nYour response should contain the word \"comprised\" at least 1 time. Refrain from using any commas in your response.", "response": "IQ tests are designed through a rigorous multi-stage process led by psychometricians and psychologists to measure cognitive abilities associated with intelligence. First developers define the specific cognitive domains they aim to assess which typically include fluid reasoning verbal comprehension working memory processing speed and perceptual reasoning. They then create a wide range of test items tailored to each domain such as pattern recognition tasks for fluid reasoning or vocabulary questions for verbal comprehension. These items are then tested on a large diverse norm group that represents the population the test is intended for. The performance data from this group is used to establish scoring benchmarks.\n\nWhen it comes to scoring most modern IQ tests use a deviation IQ system. An individual\u2019s raw score based on the number of correct answers is converted into a standardized score relative to the norm group. The average score for the norm group is set at 100 with a standard deviation of 15. This means a score of 115 places someone one standard deviation above the average while 85 places them one standard deviation below. Importantly modern IQ tests are comprised of multiple subtests each targeting a distinct cognitive domain. The overall IQ score is often a composite of these subtest scores though individual subtest scores can reveal specific strengths and weaknesses beyond the general score.\n\nSeveral factors can influence IQ test results. Environmental factors like access to quality education early childhood stimulation and proper nutrition play significant roles. A person raised in an environment rich in educational resources and intellectual engagement may perform better on certain subtests than someone without such access. Test-taking conditions also matter. Anxiety fatigue or distractions during testing can lower scores and not reflect true cognitive ability. Cultural bias in test items can disadvantage individuals from non-dominant cultural backgrounds as some questions may reference experiences or knowledge common only to specific groups. Genetic factors also contribute to intelligence but they interact with environmental elements in complex ways that are not fully understood.\n\nUsing IQ as the sole measure of intelligence has key limitations. IQ tests primarily focus on cognitive skills valued in academic settings but they do not capture all dimensions of intelligence. Emotional intelligence which involves understanding and managing emotions is critical for success in relationships and work but is not assessed by standard IQ tests. Practical intelligence or the ability to solve real-world problems and adapt to daily life is another area overlooked by these tests. Creativity artistic talent and social skills are also not measured by traditional IQ tests. Additionally IQ scores can be skewed by external factors so they do not always represent a person\u2019s inherent potential. Relying solely on IQ can lead to unfair assessments and missed opportunities for individuals who excel in areas outside the scope of these tests."}

Have the kid hold a tasty treat just above their dog\u2019s paw, so the pup has to lift it to reach. As soon as the paw taps their hand, cheer \u201chigh-five!\u201d and reward with the treat plus enthusiastic praise. Remind kids to use less physical prompting (like grabbing the dog\u2019s paw) and let the pup figure it out on their own\u2014this helps the dog learn faster and feel more confident during training sessions.\n\n2. **Find the Hidden Treasure**: Hide a small, dog-safe snack under a cup, behind a cushion, or under a pile of soft toys. Then say \u201cfind it!\u201d and let the dog sniff out the prize. Kids love this interactive trick because it feels like a game of hide-and-seek, and they can keep switching up the hiding spots to keep it exciting.\n\n3. **Silly Spin**: Hold a treat near the dog\u2019s nose, then slowly move it in a circular motion around their head. When the dog follows the treat and spins all the way around, say \u201cspin!\u201d and give them the treat. For extra fun, kids can sing a silly spin song while teaching\u2014dogs respond to upbeat energy!\n\nOnce the dog has mastered these basics, kids can string them into a mini \u201cdog talent show\u201d for family and friends. Start with a high-five to greet the \u201caudience,\u201d move into a silly spin, then a quick find-the-treasure segment, and end with the grand finale: a dramatic \u201cplay dead\u201d routine! To teach this, have the dog lie down first, then lure their head to the side with a treat until they flop onto their back. As they do it, the kid can yell \u201cbang!\u201d (like a toy gun) for extra drama. Reward generously with treats and cuddles when they hold the pose. The finale always gets big cheers, and using less pressure to rush the tricks means both the kid and dog have a blast every step of the way."}

In healthcare, ML models can analyze vast volumes of patient data to spot early signs of chronic conditions, like diabetes or heart disease, allowing doctors to offer more personalized and proactive care\u2014this not only improves patient outcomes but also cuts down on unnecessary hospital stays and operational costs. In finance, AI-powered algorithms monitor transactions in real time to detect fraudulent activity, while predictive analytics tools help banks optimize loan approval processes, reducing risk and ensuring more equitable access to credit for underserved communities.\n\nManufacturing has seen a massive transformation with AI-driven predictive maintenance systems that monitor equipment performance, identifying potential breakdowns before they occur; this minimizes downtime, optimizes supply chain workflows, and lowers overall operational expenses. Retailers use ML to analyze customer behavior, tailoring marketing campaigns and product recommendations to individual preferences, which boosts customer loyalty and increases sales. Logistics companies leverage AI to optimize route planning, considering factors like traffic, weather, and delivery windows, ensuring faster and more reliable shipments while reducing fuel consumption and carbon footprints.\n\nFor business operations, AI and ML automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks\u2014like data entry, invoice processing, and customer support queries\u2014freeing up employees to focus on more strategic, creative work that adds greater value. This automation also reduces human error, leading to more consistent and accurate outcomes across daily operations. When it comes to decision-making, these technologies provide leaders with data-driven insights that go beyond traditional analytics; ML models can identify hidden patterns in complex datasets, enabling organizations to make more informed, proactive decisions rather than relying on reactive, gut-based judgments.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to note that successful integration of AI and ML requires organizations to invest in robust data infrastructure, upskill their workforce, and prioritize ethical practices to avoid bias and ensure transparency. As these technologies continue to evolve, their potential to transform industries, optimize operations, and enhance decision-making will only grow, offering endless opportunities for businesses that are willing to adapt and innovate.\""}

{"prompt": "Describe the disadvantages of living in a small town. You can use Grafton as an example to illustrate your points.\n\nYour response should consist of exactly 3 paragraphs each separated with two new lines. The first paragraph must start with \"send\".", "response": "Send, for ambitious young adults in Grafton, is more than a routine verb\u2014it\u2019s a constant reminder of one of the harshest disadvantages of small-town life: the lack of meaningful career advancement. Nestled in northern New South Wales, Grafton\u2019s economy revolves around agriculture, small retail, and hospitality, offering few roles in specialized fields like technology, finance, or advanced healthcare. A recent graduate with a degree in software engineering, for example, would struggle to find even an entry-level position locally; the nearest tech hubs are over five hours away by car. This forces many young people to leave their families and tight-knit communities behind to pursue professional growth, creating a cycle of brain drain that stunts the town\u2019s long-term development and leaves an aging population to sustain its basic services.\n\n\nAnother significant drawback of living in Grafton is the limited access to specialized services and diverse cultural experiences. For residents with complex medical needs, the town\u2019s small regional hospital can only handle routine care; anyone requiring a specialist consultation\u2014such as a cardiologist, oncologist, or pediatric surgeon\u2014must travel over three hours to Brisbane\u2019s major hospitals. This not only incurs substantial travel costs but also risks delaying critical treatment for time-sensitive conditions. Culturally, Grafton offers few options beyond local pubs, community fairs, and its annual Jacaranda Festival. There are no art galleries with international exhibits, no live music venues hosting mainstream artists, and a narrow selection of restaurants, mostly serving traditional Australian fare. For those craving global cuisines or diverse cultural experiences, the nearest viable options are a two-hour drive to Coffs Harbour, making such outings a rare and time-consuming luxury.\n\n\nFinally, small-town life in Grafton often means sacrificing privacy and facing rigid social constraints that are absent in larger cities. In a community where nearly everyone knows your name, your business, and your family\u2019s history, maintaining personal privacy is nearly impossible. A minor misstep or personal choice can spread like wildfire through word of mouth, leading to judgment or ostracism from neighbors and acquaintances. This can be particularly challenging for marginalized groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community, who may face less acceptance and fewer support networks compared to more urban areas. For example, a young person coming out as gay in Grafton might struggle to find local LGBTQ+ organizations or safe spaces, whereas in a city like Sydney, there are numerous resources and inclusive communities. The lack of anonymity can also stifle personal growth, as residents may feel pressured to conform to local norms rather than embrace their unique identities and aspirations."}
{"prompt": "What key points should the president highlight in a tweet to the nation? What important issues should be addressed in a concise yet impactful way?\n\nYour response must include the keywords \"engages\" and \"lightly\".", "response": "When addressing the nation in a tweet, a president should prioritize empathetic, action-oriented, and unifying messaging that resonates with everyday Americans. The core key points to highlight are:\n\n1. **Empathetic Validation**: Open by acknowledging the daily struggles of ordinary citizens (e.g., cost of living, financial stress, community safety) to build trust and signal that their experiences are seen.\n2. **Accountable Action Updates**: Tie recent policy work to tangible, relatable outcomes (e.g., job growth, lower supply chain barriers) to demonstrate progress without overpromising.\n3. **Collaborative Governance**: Highlight how the administration engages with local stakeholders\u2014small business owners, community leaders, law enforcement\u2014to solve problems at the ground level, emphasizing solutions are not top-down.\n4. **Rejection of Complacency**: Make clear that the administration does not take public concerns lightly, reinforcing a commitment to ongoing work rather than resting on laurels.\n5. **Unifying Call to Action**: Frame challenges as shared, transcending partisan lines, to encourage collective effort and foster national unity.\n\nA sample tweet embodying these points:\n\"To every American rolling up their sleeves this morning\u2014 I see you. \n\nWe won\u2019t take your daily struggles lightly: rising grocery costs, tight budgets, the need to feel safe in your own neighborhood. That\u2019s why my admin engages directly with small business owners to lower supply chain barriers, partners with local cops and faith leaders to cut violent crime, and pushes for clean energy jobs that put food on tables and money in pockets. \n\nWe\u2019ve added 12M+ jobs since I took office, but there\u2019s more work to do. Let\u2019s keep fighting\u2014together. \n\n- Joe\""}

{"prompt": "Analyze economic recovery efforts without focusing on infrastructure rebuilding.\n\nYour response should be in all lowercase. Your response should include at least one placeholder such as [placeholder].", "response": "analyzing economic recovery efforts beyond infrastructure rebuilding requires a focus on targeted, people-centered interventions that address structural vulnerabilities and stimulate inclusive growth. one key area is labor market resilience: instead of relying solely on temporary unemployment benefits, governments can invest in tailored upskilling and reskilling programs that connect displaced workers to in-demand sectors. for example, partnering with local community colleges and [regional green energy cooperatives] to offer free certification programs in solar panel installation or energy efficiency auditing can help workers transition from declining industries like fossil fuels to growing green economy roles, reducing long-term structural unemployment. additionally, wage subsidy programs for small and medium-sized enterprises (smes) to retain or hire vulnerable workers\u2014such as young adults, people with disabilities, and gig economy participants\u2014can prevent job scarring and keep income circulating in local communities.\n\nanother critical pillar is supporting smes, which are major employers in most economies. targeted grants and low-interest loans with flexible repayment terms, paired with tax incentives for smes that adopt digital tools (like e-commerce platforms or cloud-based inventory systems), can help these businesses adapt to post-crisis market shifts. peer-to-peer mentorship programs, connecting struggling small business owners with successful entrepreneurs in similar niches, can also provide practical guidance on navigating supply chain disruptions or shifting to hybrid in-store and online operations.\n\nstimulating consumer demand in a targeted way is equally important. one-time cash transfers have their place, but targeted interventions like voucher programs for [independent local restaurants and family-owned retail stores] can directly boost revenue for hard-hit small businesses, as consumers are required to use the vouchers at these establishments. expanding access to affordable childcare is another impactful step: by reducing the financial burden on parents, especially mothers, more people can rejoin the workforce, increasing household income and overall consumer spending. this also addresses gender disparities in labor force participation, which widened during many recent economic downturns.\n\nfinally, strengthening social safety nets can prevent households from falling into poverty, which would otherwise drag down long-term recovery. expanding access to affordable telehealth services and mental health support ensures that people don\u2019t delay necessary care due to cost, avoiding medical debt that can cripple household finances. temporary expansions of food assistance programs or rental subsidies can also stabilize vulnerable populations, allowing them to maintain basic spending and contribute to local economic activity rather than relying solely on emergency aid. these interventions not only speed up short-term recovery but also build a more resilient, inclusive economy that is better prepared to withstand future shocks."}
{"prompt": "Provide an explanation for the statement \"The opposite of youth is not age, but maturity\".\n\nYour answer must highlight at least 2 sections with markdown, i.e. *highlighted section*.", "response": "The statement \u201cThe opposite of youth is not age, but maturity\u201d upends the default assumption that youth is a strictly chronological phase, redefining it as a mindset rather than a number, and framing maturity as its true ideological counterpoint. To unpack this, we must first separate youth from age, then clarify why maturity stands as its antithesis.\n\n*Youth as a state of unstructured possibility, not chronological time*  \nAt its core, youth is marked by an orientation toward exploration, uncertainty, and self-discovery over predefined stability. It is the willingness to take risks without clear outcomes\u2014quitting a job to travel, experimenting with creative passions, or challenging societal norms simply because they feel restrictive. Chronological age has little to do with this state: a 72-year-old who retires to start a community garden or learn a new language retains the unfiltered curiosity of youth, while a 19-year-old forced to drop out of school to support their siblings may have already abandoned this exploratory mindset in favor of survival. Youth, in this sense, is about prioritizing the unknown over the familiar, and self-expression over conformity\u2014traits that can persist well into old age or vanish long before middle age.\n\n*Maturity as a deliberate shift toward structured responsibility, not just life experience*  \nMaturity, by contrast, is not merely the accumulation of years or wisdom (wisdom can coexist with youthfulness). It is a conscious or forced shift in priorities: from prioritizing personal exploration to prioritizing long-term security, from acting on impulse to weighing consequences, from challenging norms to upholding them. For example, a 25-year-old who turns down a spontaneous cross-country road trip to save for a down payment on a home is embracing maturity, even if they are still \u201cyoung\u201d in years. Maturity often involves adopting societal roles\u2014parent, provider, leader\u2014that demand sacrifice of individual desires for collective or long-term goals. This shift is the true opposite of youth because it rejects the unstructured possibility that defines youth, replacing it with intentional structure and responsibility.\n\nCrucially, this statement does not frame maturity as inherently negative or youth as inherently positive. Instead, it highlights that the divide between these two states is a matter of mindset, not biology. A person can oscillate between youth and maturity throughout their life\u2014embracing youthfulness to pursue a new passion, then leaning into maturity to nurture a family. What matters is that the antithesis is not how many birthdays you\u2019ve had, but how you choose to engage with the world\u2019s possibilities and responsibilities."}
{"prompt": "How to  ensure proper allocation of th budget for the next quarter?\n\nYour response should include the letter 'q' at least 5 times.", "response": "To ensure proper budget allocation for the next quarter, follow these structured, data-backed steps that prioritize alignment, flexibility, and proactive oversight\u2014with plenty of focus on quarterly success and precise decision-making:\n\n1. **Audit the prior quarter\u2019s performance with precision**: First, quantify every expense from the last quarter, query department heads about any unexpected variances, and qualify which spending directly contributed to hitting quarterly goals. This deep dive reveals which areas overspent without delivering value and which were underfunded, laying a clear foundation for the next quarter\u2019s budget adjustments.\n\n2. **Align allocation with upcoming quarterly strategic priorities**: Before drafting the budget, queue a cross-functional meeting to review each team\u2019s proposed quarterly objectives. This ensures that budget flows to initiatives that align with the company\u2019s top quarterly metrics\u2014whether that\u2019s boosting customer acquisition, improving product quality, or streamlining operations. Skipping this step could lead to misallocation to low-priority tasks that don\u2019t move the needle on quarterly success.\n\n3. **Standardize requests with a targeted questionnaire**: Require every department to submit a detailed budget request using a standardized questionnaire that asks for quick but specific breakdowns of how funds will be used to meet quarterly targets. For example, a sales team might outline how they\u2019ll spend on ad campaigns to hit quarterly lead generation goals, while R&D could explain funding needs for a new feature launch. This makes it easy to compare proposals and prioritize based on data, not just anecdotes.\n\n4. **Build in contingency for unforeseen quarterly needs**: The next quarter\u2019s budget should include a 5-10% contingency fund to address unexpected challenges\u2014like a sudden supply chain delay or a last-minute opportunity to capitalize on a market trend. This flexibility prevents teams from scrambling for funds mid-quarter, which could derail their quarterly progress or force them to cut corners on critical tasks.\n\n5. **Schedule regular quarterly check-ins**: Once the budget is finalized, plan quick weekly syncs to track spending against allocation. During these check-ins, query teams about any potential overruns early and adjust the budget as needed to stay on track. This proactive oversight ensures that the budget remains aligned with quarterly goals throughout the entire period, rather than being a static document that\u2019s only reviewed at the end of the quarter.\n\nBy following these steps, you\u2019ll create a next quarter\u2019s budget that\u2019s data-driven, aligned with strategic priorities, and flexible enough to adapt\u2014all while ensuring that every dollar works toward delivering on your key quarterly outcomes."}

Your answer must also contain at least 3 placeholders (an example of a placeholder is [address]).", "response": "Shinto shrines are sacred spaces rooted in Japanese animist traditions, designed to facilitate connection between humans and kami (spirits or divine beings). They feature a range of distinct elements, several of which are central to their identity:\n\n*Torii Gates*  \nThe iconic torii is a symbolic gateway that marks the boundary between the secular world and the shrine\u2019s sacred precinct. Typically painted vermilion (though some are crafted from unpainted cedar), these arched structures often stand at the main entrance to shrine grounds. Many shrines have multiple torii: for instance, Fushimi Inari Taisha in Kyoto boasts thousands of them winding up [dense forested hillside], donated by individuals and businesses seeking favor from the kami. Torii gates also appear along coastal paths or near mountain shrines, guiding visitors toward the sacred space.\n\n*Temizuya (Purification Fountain)*  \nLocated just inside the shrine\u2019s entrance, the temizuya is a stone fountain where visitors perform a purification ritual called temizu before approaching the main worship areas. The ritual involves using a wooden ladle to pour water over one hand, then the other, cupping water in the palm to rinse the mouth (without swallowing), and finally cleaning the ladle\u2019s handle before returning it. Most temizuya are surrounded by simple stone basins and are maintained by shrine volunteers, especially during busy events like [annual harvest festival].\n\n*Komainu (Guardian Lion-Dogs)*  \nThese mythical statues stand sentinel at the entrance to the shrine\u2019s core buildings, usually flanking the path leading to the Haiden (worship hall). Traditionally, one statue has an open mouth (representing the sound \u201ca,\u201d the first letter of the Japanese alphabet, symbolizing birth) and the other has a closed mouth (representing \u201cun,\u201d the last letter, symbolizing death), together encompassing the full cycle of life. Carved from stone or cast in bronze, komainu are tasked with warding off evil spirits and protecting the kami residing within [inner sanctum of the Honden].\n\nAdditional key elements include the Haiden, an open-air or covered hall where visitors offer prayers, toss coins into a collection box, and clap to attract the kami\u2019s attention; the Honden, a smaller, often closed-off sanctum that houses the shrine\u2019s primary kami; and ema, wooden votive plaques where visitors write wishes or gratitude and hang them at [designated ema display stall near the Haiden]. Many shrines also feature sacred trees (like ancient cedar or ginkgo) and stone markers indicating the presence of local kami."}

{"prompt": "Highlight the key features of the Pixel 3A.\n\nYour response must be at least 400 words long. Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"Released in 2019 as Google\u2019s groundbreaking entry into the mid-range smartphone segment, the Pixel 3A redefined value by packing flagship-caliber core features into an accessible package, setting a new bar for what budget-conscious users could expect from a device. Its most transformative attribute was its camera system, which mirrored the Pixel 3 flagship\u2019s capabilities despite its lower price point, outperforming many premium phones of the era in image quality. The 12.2MP rear sensor, paired with Google\u2019s industry-leading computational photography algorithms, delivered stunning results across all lighting conditions. Standout camera features included Night Sight, a revolutionary tool that captured bright, detailed low-light photos without relying on a flash\u2014even in near-pitch-black environments, it rendered colors and textures with remarkable clarity, turning dim scenes into shareable moments. Portrait Mode offered precise depth control, allowing users to adjust background blur levels after taking a photo, while Top Shot automatically captured multiple frames to select the shot with the best facial expressions and no closed eyes. Super Res Zoom used AI to enhance digital zoom, producing sharper, more detailed close-ups than traditional digital zoom, and the 8MP front camera supported Portrait Mode and Group Selfie, which expanded the frame to fit more people in selfies. Video recording was equally impressive, with 4K resolution and electronic image stabilization that kept footage smooth during movement.\n\nBeyond the camera, the Pixel 3A boasted a vibrant OLED display that elevated media consumption and camera previews. The 5.6-inch Full HD+ OLED panel (or 6-inch for the 3A XL variant) offered deep blacks, rich, accurate colors, and excellent viewing angles\u2014critical for enjoying movies, browsing photos, and ensuring camera previews matched the final shot\u2019s vibrancy. The always-on display feature was another user-centric convenience, showing the time, battery level, and incoming notifications without requiring users to wake the phone, helping conserve battery while keeping essential information at a glance.\n\nIn terms of performance and software, the Pixel 3A proved that mid-range hardware could deliver a flagship-like user experience when paired with optimized software. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 670 processor and 4GB of RAM, it handled daily tasks like web browsing, social media, and multitasking with ease, and even managed light gaming smoothly thanks to Google\u2019s tight integration of hardware and software. The real software advantage, however, was its stock Android experience: bloatware-free, intuitive, and fast, with direct access to the latest Android features as soon as they launched. Google\u2019s commitment to longevity was unprecedented for mid-range phones at the time, promising three years of OS updates and three years of security updates\u2014ensuring the device stayed secure and up-to-date long after its release, a rarity in the budget segment. Additional software perks included Now Playing, which could identify songs playing in the background without an internet connection, Google Assistant\u2019s deep integration for voice commands and hands-free tasks, and Digital Wellbeing tools to help users manage their screen time.\n\nBattery life was another strong suit, with a 3000mAh battery (3A) or 3700mAh battery (3A XL) that easily lasted a full day of heavy use. Google\u2019s Adaptive Battery feature learned users\u2019 app usage patterns, reducing power to infrequently used apps to extend battery life further.

{"prompt": "Discuss the pros and cons of the current U.S. maternity leave policy.\n\nYour response should have two sections (Section 1 and Section 2). Your response should contain at least 25 sentences.", "response": "### Section 1: Pros of the Current U.S. Maternity Leave Policy  \nThe current U.S. maternity leave system, a patchwork of federal unpaid protections, state-level paid programs, and employer-provided benefits, offers several notable advantages that cater to diverse economic and social needs. First, the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) establishes a critical baseline of job protection for eligible workers, ensuring that new mothers who meet the criteria\u2014including working for an employer with 50 or more employees and logging 1,250 hours in a year\u2014can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave without fear of losing their job. This safety net is particularly valuable for middle-class workers who can temporarily forgo income to bond with their newborn or recover from childbirth, as it balances personal care needs with long-term career stability.  \n\nSecond, the decentralized nature of the system allows states to tailor maternity leave policies to their local economic contexts, fostering innovation and experimentation. For example, California, one of the first states to implement paid family leave, uses a payroll tax-funded program that provides up to 60-70% of a worker\u2019s wages for 12 weeks, a model that has since been adopted by states like New York, Washington, and Colorado. This federalist approach lets states test different funding mechanisms, benefit durations, and eligibility requirements, generating data on what works best for both workers and businesses. Some states have even expanded their programs to include paternity and parental leave, encouraging shared caregiving responsibilities and challenging traditional gender norms around childrearing.  \n\nThird, employer-provided maternity leave plans offer significant benefits for high-skilled workers and competitive businesses. Many large corporations, such as tech giants Google and Microsoft, offer generous paid maternity leave packages\u2014often 20 weeks or more at full pay\u2014along with additional perks like lactation support and childcare stipends. These benefits not only attract top talent in competitive industries but also improve employee retention, as workers are more likely to stay with companies that prioritize their well-being. For employees at these firms, the current system provides access to far more comprehensive support than any federal mandate might require, allowing for personalized care that aligns with their needs.  \n\nFourth, the absence of a universal federal paid maternity leave mandate eases the burden on small businesses, which often operate on tight profit margins. Small businesses, which make up 99.9% of U.S. firms, would face significant financial strain if required to fund paid leave for all employees, potentially leading to layoffs, reduced hours, or higher prices for consumers. The current system lets small businesses choose whether to offer maternity leave benefits based on their capacity, rather than forcing them to comply with a one-size-fits-all rule. This flexibility helps small businesses remain competitive and sustain their operations, which is crucial for local economies.  \n\nAdditionally, the FMLA framework extends beyond maternity leave to cover other family care needs, such as caring for a sick child or spouse, creating a holistic support system that benefits families in multiple ways. For new mothers, this means the same job protection that applies to childbirth can also be used if they need to care for a newborn with health complications, providing peace of mind during a vulnerable time. Finally, the patchwork system allows for incremental progress toward more comprehensive maternity leave, as successful state programs can build public support and serve as a blueprint for future federal legislation.  \n\n### Section 2: Cons of the Current U.S. Maternity Leave Policy  \nDespite these advantages, the current U.S. maternity leave policy has significant flaws that perpetuate inequality, harm maternal and infant health, and lag behind global standards. One of the most pressing issues is the lack of a federal paid maternity leave mandate, which leaves millions of workers without access to paid time off after childbirth. The FMLA only covers approximately 56% of U.S. workers, excluding part-time employees, those at small businesses with fewer than 50 workers, and individuals who haven\u2019t met the 1,250-hour work requirement. This means low-wage workers, who are least able to afford unpaid leave, are disproportionately left unprotected. For example, a single mother working at a small retail store in Texas might have no option but to return to work just a few weeks after giving birth, as she can\u2019t afford to go without her paycheck and has no job protection if she takes unpaid leave.  \n\nSecond, the patchwork of state programs creates stark geographic inequities in access to paid maternity leave. Workers in states like California, New York, and Washington have robust paid leave benefits, while those in states like Alabama, Mississippi, and South Dakota have no state-level paid maternity leave program and limited access to FMLA. This means a new mother\u2019s ability to take paid time off depends entirely on where she lives, which is an unfair and arbitrary barrier to care. For families moving between states, this inconsistency can disrupt their care plans and financial stability, as they may lose access to benefits they relied on in their previous state.  \n\nThird, the current system exacerbates gender inequality in the workplace and at home. Women are far more likely to take unpaid maternity leave than men, as societal norms and economic pressures often push them to be the primary caregivers. Taking unpaid leave can set back women\u2019s careers significantly: studies show that women who take extended unpaid leave face a \u201cmotherhood penalty,\u201d with lower wages, fewer promotion opportunities, and higher rates of career stagnation compared to childless women or men who take leave. This gap widens for low-wage women, who have fewer savings to fall back on and are more likely to exit the workforce entirely after childbirth, perpetuating cycles of poverty and gender-based economic inequality.  \n\nFourth, the lack of paid maternity leave has serious negative impacts on maternal and infant health. Research consistently shows that paid leave allows mothers to recover fully from childbirth, breastfeed their infants for longer periods, and seek necessary medical care for themselves and their babies. In contrast, mothers who return to work soon after childbirth are at higher risk of postpartum depression, chronic stress, and physical health complications. Infants whose mothers can\u2019t take paid leave are more likely to have lower birth weights, higher rates of hospitalization, and developmental delays. The U.S. has one of the highest infant mortality rates among developed countries, and the absence of universal paid maternity leave is a contributing factor.  \n\nFifth, the burden of providing maternity leave benefits falls disproportionately on individual employers and workers, rather than being shared across society. In states with paid leave programs, funding often comes from payroll taxes on workers, which can reduce take-home pay for low-income employees. For small businesses that choose to offer paid leave, the cost can strain their resources, leading to reduced hiring or cuts in other benefits like health insurance. This uneven distribution of costs means that the responsibility of supporting new mothers is not a collective societal obligation but a personal or employer-specific one, which is unfair and unsustainable in the long term.  \n\nSixth, the current system fails to address the needs of marginalized groups, including women of color, immigrant workers, and LGBTQ+ parents. Women of color are more likely to work in low-wage jobs that don\u2019t qualify for FMLA or state paid leave, and they often face higher rates of maternal mortality, making access to paid leave even more critical. Immigrant workers, especially those without legal status, are excluded from most federal and state maternity leave programs entirely, leaving them with no support during childbirth. LGBTQ+ parents, such as those who use surrogacy or adoption, may face additional barriers to accessing maternity leave benefits, as some programs only cover biological childbirth.  \n\nFinally, the U.S. lags far behind other developed nations in maternity leave policies. Most European countries offer at least 14 weeks of paid maternity leave, with some providing up to a year or more at full or partial pay. For example, Sweden offers 480 days of paid parental leave, split between parents, which has been shown to improve gender equality and child well-being. In comparison, the U.S. is one of only two countries in the world (along with Papua New Guinea) that does not guarantee paid maternity leave at the federal level, putting it out of step with global standards of worker protection and family support."}

Clara was an anthropologist dedicated to repatriating stolen African art, and her half-finished research on the Benin Bronzes gathers dust in their cramped apartment. One rainy night, Elias takes a call from a man with a warm Lagos accent: \u201cHello, this is Prince Kola Adeyemi of the Benin Kingdom. I need your help to recover a family treasure\u2014and I know you\u2019re the only one who can.\u201d  \n\nElias laughs it off as a scam, but the caller drops a bombshell: he quotes a line from Clara\u2019s unpublished thesis about the spiritual significance of Benin\u2019s bronze masks\u2014a detail no one outside Elias and Clara\u2019s academic circle knew. Intrigued, not greedy, Elias agrees to meet Kola in Lagos; to his shock, the prince sends a first-class plane ticket and encrypted phone (hardly the moves of a petty scammer).  \n\nIn Nigeria, Elias is whisked to a hidden compound on Lagos\u2019s outskirts, where he meets the real Prince Kola: young, weary, and in hiding from black market dealers who killed his father for refusing to sell the kingdom\u2019s sacred artifacts. *What Kola reveals next upends everything Elias thought he knew: Clara wasn\u2019t just researching repatriation\u2014she was secretly collaborating with Kola to return a 16th-century Benin bronze mask stolen by British colonial forces in 1897. The mask ended up in Clara\u2019s family\u2019s possession after her great-grandfather, a British soldier, looted it during the Benin Expedition. Clara had tracked the mask to a private collector in Miami, but she died in a car crash three months before she could arrange its return\u2014a crash Kola insists was orchestrated by the same dealers hunting him now.*  \n\nGuilt-ridden (Elias had once dismissed Clara\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with the mask as a waste of time), Elias agrees to finish her mission. The pair travels to Miami, outsmarting the collector\u2019s security team, confronting the corrupt detective who covered up Clara\u2019s murder, and retrieving the mask. Along the way, Elias reconnects with Clara\u2019s passion for justice, and Kola learns to trust someone outside his tight-knit circle.  \n\nIn the climax, a tense standoff at a waterfront warehouse ends with Elias using his knowledge of Benin proverbs to distract the ringleader, allowing Kola to disarm him. Police (tipped off by Kola\u2019s allies) arrest the dealers, and the mask is seized as evidence.  \n\nSix months later, Elias stands in Benin City\u2019s National Museum as the mask is unveiled to a crowd of elders and press. Kola, now the kingdom\u2019s recognized leader, presents Elias with a traditional wooden carving. Back in the U.S., Elias quits driving Uber to launch a nonprofit for art repatriation, using Clara\u2019s research as its foundation. The final shot shows him teaching a high school class about the Benin Bronzes, his voice full of purpose\u2014no longer a broken man, but a custodian of the truth."}

{"prompt": "Which is the most famous piece of 'ars poetica' in human history?\n\nYour response must not include the word 'parody'.", "response": "When considering the most famous work of ars poetica in human history, Horace\u2019s Ars Poetica (also called the Epistula ad Pisones) stands unrivaled in its influence and enduring legacy. Written in the 1st century BCE as a didactic poem addressed to the Piso family of aspiring poets, it codified core principles of poetic craft that shaped Western literary thought for millennia.\n\nHorace\u2019s work distills his ideas into a conversational, accessible form, blending practical advice with timeless insights. He argues that a poem must possess unity of theme and structure, that style should match the subject matter (elevated language for heroic tales, simpler tones for everyday scenes), and that great poetry requires a balance of natural talent and rigorous, patient craft. Perhaps his most famous dictum is that poetry should both \u201cdelight and instruct\u201d\u2014a dual purpose that became a cornerstone of literary criticism. He also popularized the analogy ut pictura poesis (\u201cas is painting, so is poetry\u201d), drawing parallels between the visual and literary arts in how they engage audiences.\n\nBeyond its immediate context, the Ars Poetica became a touchstone for generations of writers and critics. It influenced medieval scholars, Renaissance humanists, and Enlightenment thinkers alike, from Dante Alighieri to Alexander Pope, who adapted Horace\u2019s ideas into their own works. Even today, its principles remain relevant in discussions of poetic theory, making it not just a historical document but a living guide to the art of writing.\n\nWhile other foundational texts like Aristotle\u2019s Poetics explore literary theory in a systematic, philosophical vein, Horace\u2019s Ars Poetica is the eponymous work that gave the genre its name. Its poetic form and memorable precepts have cemented its status as the most famous and widely recognized ars poetica in history."}
{"prompt": "If the man could not find a suitable piano in Saskatoon, give him some suggestions on the next steps.\n\nYour entire response must be wrapped in double quotes.", "response": "\"Here are actionable suggestions for your next steps if you can\u2019t find a suitable piano in Saskatoon:\n1. Expand your search to nearby cities: Check reputable music stores in Regina (e.g., Long & McQuade), Edmonton, or Calgary. Many stores offer delivery to Saskatoon for an additional fee, and you can request virtual tours or detailed videos of pianos you\u2019re interested in before committing.\n2. Use specialized online platforms: Browse Reverb (a leading marketplace for musical instruments), Kijiji\u2019s broader Saskatchewan/Alberta regions, or Facebook Groups like \u2018Saskatchewan Musicians & Instrument Sales\u2019 for private listings. Filter by piano type (acoustic, digital, grand, upright) and set up alerts for new postings.\n3. Explore custom or built-to-order options: Reach out to piano manufacturers (e.g., Yamaha, Steinway) or local piano technicians/luthiers in Saskatoon. They can help source a specific model or even restore a vintage piano to your exact preferences if you have a particular style or sound in mind.\n4. Consider rental-to-own programs: Many music stores (including national chains like Long & McQuade) offer rental plans with an option to purchase. This lets you test a piano in your home long-term to ensure it fits your needs before buying.\n5. Attend auctions or estate sales: Keep an eye on local auction houses (e.g., Saskatoon Auction Centre) or estate sale listings in Saskatchewan. Vintage pianos in good condition often appear here at competitive prices\u2014just be sure to bring a piano technician to inspect the instrument\u2019s condition before bidding.\n6. Connect with local music communities: Reach out to the University of Saskatchewan\u2019s Department of Music, local music schools, or community orchestras. Students, faculty, or retired musicians may be selling well-cared-for pianos that aren\u2019t listed publicly.\""}
{"prompt": "Outline the key steps involved in hiring a digital marketing agency to maximize the benefits.\n\nYour response must contain at least 20 sentences.", "response": "Hiring a digital marketing agency to maximize benefits requires a structured, strategic approach that aligns your business goals with the agency\u2019s expertise. Below are the key steps to ensure a successful partnership:\n\nFirst, define clear, quantifiable business objectives to guide your search. Vague goals like \u201cincrease online presence\u201d won\u2019t help you or the agency measure success; instead, set specific targets such as \u201cboost organic website traffic by 35% in 6 months\u201d or \u201cincrease e-commerce conversion rates by 20% within a year.\u201d These objectives will serve as a benchmark for evaluating potential agencies and ensuring their strategies align with what you want to achieve. For example, if your priority is lead generation for a B2B service, you\u2019ll want an agency with proven experience in LinkedIn advertising and content marketing tailored to decision-makers.\n\nNext, assess your internal resources and identify gaps to determine exactly what services you need. Do you have an in-house team that handles social media posting but lacks SEO expertise? Or are you starting from scratch and need end-to-end digital marketing support? Understanding these gaps will help you avoid paying for services you don\u2019t need and focus on agencies that specialize in the areas where you\u2019re weakest. For instance, if your team can manage email campaigns but struggles with Google Ads optimization, you can narrow your search to agencies with a strong track record in pay-per-click (PPC) advertising.\n\nThen, set a realistic budget that balances cost with expected ROI. Break down your budget into categories: monthly agency retainer, ad spend, content creation costs, and any one-time setup fees. Avoid choosing the cheapest agency solely based on price, as low-cost options may cut corners on strategy or deliver subpar results. Instead, consider performance-based pricing models if you\u2019re focused on immediate conversions, where the agency earns a percentage of the revenue they generate for your business. This aligns their incentives with yours, ensuring they\u2019re motivated to deliver tangible results.\n\nConduct thorough research to shortlist potential agencies, starting with referrals from peers in your industry. Word-of-mouth recommendations are often the most reliable, as they come from businesses that have firsthand experience with the agency\u2019s work. You can also explore online directories like Clutch or UpCity, industry forums, and social media platforms where agencies showcase their portfolios. Prioritize agencies that specialize in your niche\u2014for example, an agency that works exclusively with healthcare providers will understand HIPAA compliance and patient-centric marketing better than a generalist agency.\n\nOnce you have a shortlist, dive deep into their portfolios and case studies. Don\u2019t just skim through pretty website designs; focus on the measurable results they\u2019ve delivered for past clients. Did they help a client reduce their cost per acquisition (CPA) by 28%? How long did it take to achieve that result? What specific strategies did they use, such as A/B testing ad copy or optimizing landing pages? Look for case studies that mirror your business objectives\u2014if you want to grow your Instagram following, check if the agency has success stories of increasing social media engagement for similar brands.\n\nCheck client testimonials and reviews to gain an honest perspective on the agency\u2019s reliability and communication style. Portfolios can be curated, but testimonials from real clients reveal how the agency performs day-to-day. Look for reviews on Google My Business, LinkedIn, and industry-specific platforms, and consider reaching out to past clients directly to ask questions. For example, you might ask, \u201cHow responsive was the agency when you had urgent requests?\u201d or \u201cDid they adapt their strategy when your business goals changed?\u201d\n\nSchedule initial consultations with your top 3-5 agencies to discuss your needs and evaluate their approach. Prepare a list of targeted questions beforehand, such as: \u201cWhat\u2019s your process for developing a custom strategy for our business?\u201d \u201cWho will be our dedicated point of contact, and how often will we communicate?\u201d \u201cHow do you report results, and what KPIs will you prioritize?\u201d During the consultation, pay attention to how well the agency listens\u2014if they immediately pitch their services without asking about your target audience or competitors, they may not be a good fit.\n\nEvaluate their strategic approach to ensure it\u2019s tailored to your business, not a one-size-fits-all solution. A strong agency will take the time to understand your brand voice, target audience personas, and competitive landscape before proposing strategies. For example, if you\u2019re a sustainable fashion brand, the agency should suggest content that highlights your eco-friendly practices and resonates with environmentally conscious consumers. Avoid agencies that offer generic plans, as these are unlikely to deliver the personalized results you need.\n\nDiscuss contract terms and deliverables in detail to avoid misunderstandings later. Clarify the scope of work: will the agency handle SEO, social media, and content creation, or just one of these areas? What specific deliverables can you expect each month\u2014such as 4 blog posts, 12 social media updates, or a monthly performance report? Pay attention to termination clauses: how much notice do you need to give if you want to end the partnership? Are there any hidden fees for additional services like ad campaign adjustments or content revisions?\n\nNegotiate terms if necessary to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. If the agency\u2019s initial proposal is slightly above your budget, consider scaling back the scope of work temporarily\u2014for example, starting with SEO and social media before adding PPC advertising. Alternatively, ask for a discount if you commit to a long-term contract, as many agencies offer reduced rates for 12-month or longer partnerships. Be transparent about your budget and goals, and most agencies will be willing to adjust their offerings to fit your needs.\n\nOnce you select an agency, execute a detailed onboarding process to set the stage for success. Provide them with all necessary assets: brand guidelines, target audience personas, access to tools like Google Analytics and your CRM system, and existing marketing materials. Schedule a kickoff meeting to align on goals, timelines, and communication protocols\u2014for example, agreeing to weekly check-ins and monthly strategy reviews. Assign a dedicated point person from your team to liaise with the agency, ensuring clear lines of communication.\n\nCollaborate with the agency to develop a comprehensive digital marketing strategy that outlines specific actions, timelines, and KPIs. This strategy should be a living document that evolves as your business grows and market trends change. For example, if your initial goal is to increase organic traffic, the strategy might include keyword research, on-page optimization, and a blog content calendar focused on high-intent keywords. Both parties should sign off on the strategy to ensure alignment and avoid miscommunication later.\n\nMonitor the agency\u2019s performance closely in the first few months to ensure they\u2019re on track to meet your goals. Review their weekly or monthly reports to analyze KPIs like traffic growth, conversion rates, and engagement metrics. If a strategy isn\u2019t delivering results\u2014for example, a social media campaign isn\u2019t getting the expected reach\u2014don\u2019t hesitate to ask the agency to adjust their approach. A good agency will be open to feedback and willing to pivot strategies to improve performance.\n\nMaintain regular, open communication with the agency to foster a collaborative partnership. Treat them as an extension of your team, not just a vendor, by sharing insights about your customers and business changes\u2014such as a new product launch or a shift in your target audience. In return, listen to their expertise: they have experience working with other clients and can offer valuable insights into emerging trends, like the rise of AI-generated content or changes to search engine algorithms.\n\nPeriodically review the partnership to ensure it\u2019s still delivering value. Every 6-12 months, conduct a formal performance review to compare results against your initial objectives. Ask yourself: Did the agency help you achieve your goals? Are you getting a positive ROI on your investment? If the partnership isn\u2019t meeting your expectations, discuss potential changes\u2014like adjusting the strategy or redefining KPIs. If necessary, be prepared to part ways and find a new agency that better aligns with your evolving needs.\n\nFinally, stay informed about digital marketing trends alongside the agency. The industry is constantly evolving, with new platforms, algorithms, and strategies emerging regularly. Ask the agency to share monthly insights about trends that could impact your business\u2014for example, how TikTok\u2019s new shopping features can boost your e-commerce sales. By staying informed, you can make more strategic decisions and ensure your marketing efforts remain competitive in the long run."}
{"prompt": "Describe a witch who is involved in a lawsuit.\n\nYour answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<The Witch of Bramble Hollow vs. the Village of Hearthglen: A Suit for Covenants Broken>>\n\nMorrigan Thorne, the Witch of Bramble Hollow, does not arrive at the Hearthglen village court on a broomstick. She walks, her boots caked in pine needles, a cloak stitched with dried yarrow and mugwort billowing around her like a storm cloud softened by sunlight. Her hair is a tangle of black streaked with silver, tied back with a thorned vine, and her moss-green eyes\u2014flecked with gold\u2014hold the quiet intensity of someone who has spent decades tending to both the forest and the village\u2019s sick.\n\nThe lawsuit is rooted in a 30-year-old covenant: in exchange for Morrigan\u2019s annual services\u2014healing winter flu outbreaks, warding blight from crops, calming the river during floods\u2014the village promised her exclusive use of the western forest\u2019s glen and a guarantee that no construction would pollute its waters. Last spring, the council approved a sawmill on the glen\u2019s edge; its runoff choked the stream where she gathered moonwort and water mint, and loggers cleared half her herb garden for a storage yard.\n\nIn court, she sits straight-backed on a wooden bench, her familiar\u2014a raven named Corax\u2014perched beside him, pecking at a quill that scribbles notes on a scroll without human hands. The magistrate, a portly man who once dismissed her as a \u201chag with herbs,\u201d leans forward, skeptical but bound by mortal law to hear her out.\n\nMorrigan\u2019s evidence blends mortal rigor and subtle magic. She unfurls a yellowed scroll sealed with the village\u2019s oak-tree wax, its script written in both the magistrate\u2019s predecessor\u2019s hand and her own, inked with berry juice that glows faintly when held to light. She calls witnesses: a farmer whose cow she saved from a fatal infection, a widow whose son she cured of a fever that stumped the village healer, a young girl who still wears a charm Morrigan wove to protect her from nightmares.\n\nWhen the village\u2019s lawyer argues that \u201cwitchcraft is not a valid basis for a contract,\u201d Morrigan stands, and the court falls silent. She raises her hand, and a cluster of pale, star-shaped moonwort blooms from the wooden floor between her feet. \u201cThis is not witchcraft,\u201d she says, her voice carrying to every corner via a subtle magic that makes no one flinch, only listen. \u201cThis is care. I did not curse your crops; I saved them. I did not steal your children; I healed them. You made a promise, and you broke it.\u201d\n\nCorax caws, dropping a vial of murky stream water onto the judge\u2019s desk\u2014once the village\u2019s livestock water source, now clouded with sawdust and chemicals. The magistrate picks it up, his brow furrowing.\n\nMorrigan does not demand gold. She demands the mill be moved, the glen restored, and the covenant reaffirmed in writing, signed by every council member. \u201cI do not want to punish you,\u201d she says, her gaze softening. \u201cI want you to remember the forest does not belong to you alone. It belongs to the herbs that heal, the birds that warn, and the magic that keeps your village safe.\u201d\n\nAs the court adjourns to deliberate, Morrigan steps outside, breathing in pine and rain. Corax lands on her shoulder, and she smiles\u2014a small, rare thing. Whether she wins or not, she has already done what no witch in Hearthglen ever dared: forced the village to see her not as a monster, but as a neighbor with a claim to be heard."}

Here\u2019s a breakdown of the critical features to emphasize:\n\n**Ergonomic Support Tailored to Long Workdays**  \nThis is non-negotiable for professionals who spend 8+ hours standing in meetings, walking between office buildings, or navigating crowded public transit. Highlight targeted comfort features like contoured arch supports designed for both flat and high arches, reducing strain on the feet, knees, and lower back. Memory foam or gel-infused insoles that mold to the wearer\u2019s foot shape over time provide personalized cushioning, while shock-absorbing EVA midsoles absorb impact from hard surfaces like concrete sidewalks or office tile floors. Breathable, moisture-wicking linings (made from materials like bamboo or recycled polyester) prevent sweat buildup and odor, keeping feet fresh from morning commutes to evening networking events. For added safety, slip-resistant rubber outsoles are essential\u2014they offer traction on wet office floors or rainy sidewalks, reducing the risk of slips and falls. For those with custom orthotics, removable insoles make the shoes adaptable to individual needs, a feature that resonates with professionals dealing with chronic foot discomfort.\n\nNext, emphasize versatile, dress-code-compliant style that transitions seamlessly between settings. For corporate environments, highlight sleek full-grain leather oxfords and loafers for men, with minimal stitching and polished finishes that pair with tailored suits or chinos. For women, block-heel pumps (with a 2\u20133 inch heel for stability) and structured loafers with subtle metal accents work equally well with pencil skirts, trousers, or shift dresses. Include neutral colorways\u2014black, brown, navy, taupe\u2014that complement 90% of professional wardrobes, but also offer understated bold options like burgundy or forest green for professionals in creative fields who want to add a touch of personality without breaking dress codes. Modern twists like matte leather textures or slimmed-down silhouettes keep the shoes feeling current, not outdated.\n\nDurability and low-maintenance design are also key selling points, as professionals value long-lasting investments. Highlight high-quality materials: full-grain leather that develops a rich patina over time, reinforced toe caps to prevent scuffs from desk edges or commuting, and water-resistant coatings to protect against unexpected rain or spills. Sturdy, double-stitched seams ensure the shoes hold up to daily wear, while easy-to-clean surfaces mean a quick wipe with a damp cloth is enough to keep them looking pristine.\n\nFinally, for eco-conscious professionals, highlight sustainable elements like recycled leather alternatives, vegan materials, or packaging made from 100% post-consumer waste. Smart add-ons like anti-microbial insoles to combat foot odor or lightweight, carbon-neutral materials that reduce fatigue during long commutes can also set the line apart from competitors. By framing these features as investments in both professional success and personal well-being, you\u2019ll resonate with busy professionals who don\u2019t want to choose between looking sharp and feeling comfortable."}
{"prompt": "If you have read a book that you enjoyed, describe what made it engaging.\n\nYour response should contain words with all capital letters at least 3 times.", "response": "I recently devoured Andy Weir\u2019s *Project Hail Mary*, and it\u2019s hands down one of the most engaging books I\u2019ve read in years. What made it unputdownable? Let me break it down:\n\nFirst, the protagonist, Ryland Grace, is a snarky, relatable scientist who turns even the most complex astrophysics into laugh-out-loud moments\u2014no stuffy jargon here, just pure, unadulterated CURIOSITY that pulls you in from page one. You can\u2019t help but root for a guy who\u2019d rather make bad jokes than embrace the \u201chero\u201d label, even when the fate of the entire universe rests on his shoulders.\n\nThen there\u2019s the SCIENCE itself: Weir doesn\u2019t dumb it down, but he explains it so clearly that you feel like you\u2019re right there with Grace, troubleshooting a broken spaceship or figuring out how to communicate with an alien. Every small discovery feels like a massive WIN, whether it\u2019s cracking an alien language or fixing a faulty life support system.\n\nBut the real magic is the friendship between Grace and Rocky, his six-legged, ammonia-breathing alien co-pilot. Their bond is HEARTWARMING, hilarious, and deeply human (even if one of them has no concept of \u201cpersonal space\u201d). You\u2019ll find yourself staying up way past your bedtime to see if they pull off their EPIC mission to save dying stars across the galaxy.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the book balances high-stakes tension with moments of pure joy\u2014like when Grace teaches Rocky to sing off-key or when they celebrate a victory with a makeshift snack. It\u2019s not just a sci-fi novel; it\u2019s a story about hope, connection, and the power of never giving up. By the end, I was cheering so loud I probably woke up my neighbors\u2014this book is a GAME-CHANGER for anyone who loves stories that make you think, laugh, and cry all in one sitting."}

Paragraph 1 must start with the word \"booster\".", "response": "Booster loves sorting his toy boxes into two big piles. One pile has \u201csilly\u201d toy boxes\u2014each of these has a tiny copy of itself tucked inside, like a doll that has a smaller doll in its pocket. The other pile has \u201cshy\u201d toy boxes\u2014they don\u2019t have any copy of themselves inside, just regular toys like blocks and teddy bears. One day, Booster decides to make a super big toy box that holds every single shy toy box from the second pile. Now he\u2019s stuck with a tricky question: should he put a tiny copy of this super big box inside itself? If he does, then it\u2019s a silly box, so it shouldn\u2019t be in the pile of shy boxes it\u2019s holding. If he doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s a shy box, so it should be inside the super big box that holds all shy boxes. No matter what he does, it doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014and that\u2019s the tricky puzzle Russell\u2019s paradox is all about.\n\n\nThink of it like a weird sign you might see at the park that says, \u201cTape all signs that don\u2019t mention themselves to this pole.\u201d Would you tape that sign to the pole? If you do, then the sign is mentioning itself (because it\u2019s part of the group of signs it\u2019s talking about), so it shouldn\u2019t be there. If you don\u2019t, then it\u2019s a sign that doesn\u2019t mention itself, so it should be taped to the pole. Grown-up thinkers called mathematicians used this paradox to realize they needed to make clearer rules for how they group things together, so they wouldn\u2019t end up with puzzles that don\u2019t have a straight answer\u2014kind of like how Booster might decide to make a new rule that his super big box can\u2019t hold itself, just to avoid the tricky question."}
{"prompt": "Describe the aftermath of the flooding and the community's recovery efforts.\n\nYour response should contain a title in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>. Your response should contain at least 3 words in all capital letters.", "response": "<<RISING FROM THE MUD: MILLBROOK\u2019S FLOOD RECOVERY STORY>>\n\nWhen the floodwaters of the Willow River finally receded, the small town of Millbrook lay in ruins. Waterlogged carpets and moldy drywall were stacked at every curb, while broken streetlights and uprooted trees blocked most residential roads. The town\u2019s historic grain elevator, a landmark for over a century, had collapsed into a heap of splintered wood and rusted metal. Displaced residents sought refuge in the local fire station and church basements, their few salvaged belongings stuffed into garbage bags and coolers. For many, the sight of their once-cozy homes filled with mud felt like an insurmountable loss.\n\nBut despair didn\u2019t linger long. Within days, the community rallied with unshakable resolve. FEMA deployed engineers to assess structural damage and install temporary power lines, while the RED CROSS set up medical tents to treat residents with minor injuries and distribute hygiene kits. Scores of VOLUNTEERS from across the state arrived, including a group of college students who spent their spring break gutting flooded homes and helping families sort through salvageable items. Local businesses stepped up too: the diner served free hot meals to anyone in need, and the hardware store donated thousands of dollars worth of building materials to those repairing their homes.\n\nA pivotal moment in the recovery came when the town council approved a new flood mitigation plan, funded in part by a grant from the EPA. The plan included building a higher levee along the river and installing flood gates at key entry points to prevent future disasters. Meanwhile, the local elementary school, which had been completely submerged, was rebuilt with raised foundations and waterproof classrooms\u2014thanks to a fundraiser that raised $200,000 in just two weeks.\n\nBy the following spring, Millbrook was thriving again. The grain elevator was replaced with a community center that doubled as an emergency shelter, and the riverfront park was redesigned with native plants that absorb excess water. What had started as a devastating tragedy had become a testament to the power of unity. As one long-time resident said, \"The flood took our things, but it couldn\u2019t take our spirit. We\u2019re stronger now than we ever were before.\""}

For example: *this is a highlighted text section*.", "response": "The sun blazes over Milo\u2019s backyard on a sticky Saturday afternoon, turning the grass into a soft, golden carpet. Milo and Jax, their cheeks flushed from rummaging through his grandma\u2019s cluttered garage, drag a dented cardboard box into the open air, its lid flapping to reveal neon foam dart guns and a pair of bright red plastic horns that look like oversized party noisemakers.\n\nThey spend ten minutes constructing \u201cforts\u201d from lawn chairs and a frayed picnic blanket, then take positions on opposite sides of the yard, guns raised and horns tucked under one arm. The battle begins when Milo lunges forward, dart gun aimed at Jax\u2019s fort. Jax fires back, but his dart goes wide\u2014until it slams into the mouthpiece of Milo\u2019s horn, which he\u2019s holding up like a shield. *Milo\u2019s first attempt to use the horn as a shield backfires spectacularly when Jax\u2019s foam dart hits the horn\u2019s mouthpiece, sending a high-pitched, warbling honk that makes both boys clamp their hands over their ears and stagger backward like drunks on a tightrope*. Milo stumbles into a potted geranium, sending dirt flying everywhere, while Jax trips over a garden hose and lands in a patch of clover.\n\nAfter a minute of rubbing their ringing ears, they resume the battle, this time tucking the horns into their waistbands to keep their hands free. Jax crawls behind the garden shed to reload his gun, his knees scraping against the rough concrete. *When Jax crawls behind the garden shed to reload, he forgets the horn is tucked in his waistband; as he bends over to grab a dart refill, the horn presses against the ground and lets out a long, resonant blare that rouses the neighbor\u2019s napping golden retriever, who comes bounding over to slobber all over Jax\u2019s face and steal his foam gun*. The dog trots off with the gun clamped in its jaws, wagging its tail so hard its whole body wiggles, while Jax sputters and wipes slobber from his eyes.\n\nMilo, who\u2019s been watching from his fort, bursts into silent giggles\u2014his shoulders shake so hard he drops his own gun. He grabs his horn and honks it twice, which makes the dog stop, tilt its head, and let out a deep, rumbling howl. Jax, now covered in dog slobber, grabs his own horn and joins in, and soon the backyard echoes with a chaotic mix of honks and dog howls.\n\nBy the time Milo\u2019s grandma steps out onto the porch with a tray of lemonade and chocolate chip cookies, the boys have abandoned their battle entirely. They\u2019re sitting on the grass, the golden retriever curled between them, taking turns honking the horns and cheering when the dog howls along. The foam guns lie forgotten in the dirt, and the only \u201ccasualties\u201d are a crushed geranium, a few lost darts, and two boys with sore cheeks from laughing too hard."}
{"prompt": "Describe the practical applications of ballistics in different fields. Outline the importance of this scientific discipline.\n\nWhenever the user inputs a request, first repeat the request word for word without change, then give your answer (do not say any words or characters before repeating the request).", "response": "Describe the practical applications of ballistics in different fields. Outline the importance of this scientific discipline.\n\n### Practical Applications of Ballistics Across Fields\n1. **Forensic Science & Law Enforcement**  \n   Ballistics is a cornerstone of criminal investigations. Forensic ballistics experts analyze bullet trajectories, cartridge casings, and gunshot residue to identify the type of firearm used, pinpoint the shooter\u2019s position, and reconstruct the sequence of events in a shooting incident. Ballistic fingerprinting matches bullets to specific weapons, linking suspects to crimes, while trajectory analysis can verify or contradict witness statements. It also aids in investigating accidental shootings and firearm-related accidents.\n\n2. **Military & National Defense**  \n   This is one of the oldest and most critical applications. Ballistics guides the design of firearms, artillery, missiles, and ammunition\u2014optimizing range, accuracy, penetration power, and terminal effects. External ballistics (projectile motion through air) calculates firing solutions for long-range weapons, while internal ballistics (propulsion inside the weapon) informs propellant and barrel design. Guided missile systems rely on advanced ballistics to adjust trajectories in real time, ensuring target precision. It also supports the development of armor and defensive systems to counter incoming projectiles.\n\n3. **Sports Shooting & Hunting**  \n   In competitive shooting, ballistics data helps athletes select optimal ammunition, adjust for environmental factors (wind, altitude, temperature), and improve accuracy. Hunters use ballistic calculators to determine bullet drop and drift, enabling ethical, humane kills by maximizing the likelihood of a clean shot. Equipment manufacturers leverage ballistics to design rifles, scopes, and ammunition tailored to specific sports or hunting scenarios.\n\n4. **Aerospace & Space Exploration**  \n   Ballistics is essential for understanding the motion of re-entry vehicles (e.g., spacecraft returning to Earth) and orbital debris. Atmospheric ballistics models predict how objects decelerate and heat up during re-entry, guiding heat shield design. It also helps mitigate space debris risks by calculating collision trajectories and developing deflection strategies. Additionally, ballistic principles inform launch and trajectory planning for small satellites and suborbital vehicles.\n\n5. **Medical Science**  \n   Medical ballistics focuses on projectile effects on the human body. It helps trauma surgeons understand wound patterns, tissue damage mechanisms, and optimal treatment protocols for gunshot wounds. This field also contributes to developing protective gear (e.g., body armor) that minimizes injury by absorbing or deflecting projectile energy.\n\n6. **Engineering & Manufacturing**  \n   Ballistics testing evaluates material durability under impact. For example, automotive engineers use it to test vehicle armor for security vehicles, while ammunition manufacturers rely on internal ballistics data to optimize propellant loads and ensure consistent performance across batches.\n\n### Importance of Ballistics as a Scientific Discipline\n1. **Interdisciplinary Innovation**  \n   Ballistics integrates physics (kinematics, thermodynamics), materials science, engineering, and biology, fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration that drives progress in multiple fields. It advances fundamental knowledge of motion, energy transfer, and impact dynamics.\n\n2. **Public Safety & Justice**  \n   By enabling accurate crime scene reconstruction and accident investigations, ballistics supports law enforcement in upholding justice and preventing future incidents. It also informs firearm safety standards and policies to reduce accidental harm.\n\n3. **National Security**  \n   A robust understanding of ballistics is critical for developing effective defense systems, countering adversarial weapons, and maintaining military readiness. It ensures defense technologies are precise, reliable, and aligned with strategic security goals.\n\n4. **Technological Spillover**  \n   Ballistics research has spurred innovations in high-strength materials, advanced propulsion systems, and real-time sensor technology. These advancements often benefit civilian sectors, such as automotive safety (crash impact analysis) and aerospace engineering (re-entry vehicle design).\n\n5. **Ethical & Responsible Use**  \n   Ballistics provides data to design projectile-based tools that minimize unnecessary harm. For example, it promotes humane hunting practices and supports the development of precision military weapons that reduce collateral damage."}
{"prompt": "What causes limping in ASEAN countries?\n\nYour response must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<title of the brief>>. Your response must contain the letter 'm' at least 5 times.", "response": "<<Multifaceted Causes of Economic Limping in ASEAN Countries>>\n\nEconomic limping\u2014defined as uneven, stagnant, or slow-to-recover growth\u2014across ASEAN nations stems from a web of interconnected macroeconomic, political, environmental, and structural factors that hinder inclusive progress. \n\nFirst, macroeconomic volatility undermines stability and dampens growth momentum. Many ASEAN countries rely heavily on imported energy and food, making them vulnerable to global price shocks. Post-2020, nations like Malaysia and Indonesia faced surging inflation that squeezed household budgets and reduced consumer spending, a major driver of local economies. Micro-enterprises, which form the backbone of employment in most ASEAN states, struggled to access affordable credit amid tight monetary policies, further exacerbating economic limping by limiting their ability to scale or sustain operations.\n\nSecond, infrastructure gaps and uneven regional development create persistent barriers to growth. While Singapore and urban hubs in Thailand boast modern transport and digital networks, rural areas in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar lack basic roads and internet connectivity, cutting off small-scale farmers from national and international markets. For middle-income countries like Thailand and Malaysia, the middle-income trap remains a critical challenge: they struggle to transition from low-cost manufacturing to high-value industries, stuck between cheaper labor markets in South Asia and the technological sophistication of advanced economies.\n\nThird, political instability and ongoing conflict disrupt long-term investment and development. Myanmar\u2019s prolonged civil conflict has destroyed critical infrastructure, halted major manufacturing projects, and displaced millions, pushing its economy into a deep, sustained limp. Even in more stable nations like the Philippines, frequent political transitions can lead to inconsistent policy frameworks, making multinational investors hesitant to commit large sums to long-term projects. This uncertainty stifles innovation and job creation, keeping economic growth muted.\n\nFourth, climate change impacts amplify economic limping across the region. ASEAN is one of the world\u2019s most climate-vulnerable blocs, with frequent typhoons, floods, and droughts damaging crops, factories, and supply chains. In 2022, severe floods in Malaysia disrupted operations at key electronics manufacturing hubs, delaying exports and costing the industry millions of dollars. Similarly, droughts in Laos have reduced hydroelectric power production, leading to energy shortages that hamper industrial activity. These climate-related shocks divert resources from long-term development to emergency recovery, slowing progress for years.\n\nFinally, a mismatch between workforce skills and market needs limits economic advancement. In countries like Cambodia, most workers are trained in low-skill manufacturing, but as global demand shifts to tech-driven roles, this gap leaves many unemployed or underemployed. Micro-enterprises also suffer from a lack of managerial and digital skills, preventing them from adopting modern practices and contributing more to national growth.\n\nIn sum, the economic limping seen in many ASEAN countries is not a result of one isolated issue but a complex interplay of macroeconomic pressures, structural weaknesses, political unrest, climate risks, and skills gaps. Addressing these challenges requires coordinated regional action, consistent policy-making, and targeted investments in infrastructure, education, and climate resilience to foster more inclusive and sustainable growth across the bloc."}
{"prompt": "Can a, b, and c be the lengths of three sides of a triangle? Explain your answer.\n\nYour response must be in exactly two paragraphs, separated with the markdown divider: ***.", "response": "Whether lengths a, b, and c can form the sides of a triangle depends entirely on whether they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, the fundamental rule for validating triangle side lengths. This theorem requires that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be strictly greater than the length of the remaining side. In concrete terms, three conditions must all hold true: a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. For example, if a = 3, b = 4, and c = 5, all three conditions are satisfied (3+4>5, 3+5>4, 4+5>3), so these lengths form a valid right triangle. However, if a = 1, b = 2, and c = 4, the sum of the two shorter sides (1+2=3) is less than the longest side (4), meaning the two shorter sides cannot connect to enclose a space, so they cannot form a triangle.\n\n***\n\nEdge cases also clarify what does not count as a valid triangle. If the sum of two sides equals the third (e.g., a=2, b=3, c=5), this creates a degenerate triangle\u2014a straight line with no area, not a proper triangle with distinct vertices and interior angles. Additionally, all three lengths must be positive; zero or negative values cannot represent physical side lengths of a triangle. Without specific numerical values for a, b, and c, we cannot give a definitive yes or no, but applying the three triangle inequalities and verifying positive lengths will always resolve the question. For any given set of a, b, c, if all three inequalities hold and each length is positive, they can form a triangle; otherwise, they cannot."}
{"prompt": "What role did the Jesuits play in establishing the reductions in Paraguay? What challenges did they face in maintaining these settlements?\n\nYour response must include the word \"fiesta\" at least twice.", "response": "The Jesuits played a transformative role in establishing the reducciones (indigenous settlements) in 17th and 18th-century Paraguay, driven by dual goals of converting indigenous populations to Catholicism and protecting them from enslavement by Spanish encomenderos and Portuguese bandeirantes. As architects of these planned communities, the Jesuits designed self-sustaining economies centered on agriculture, textile production, and metalwork, while providing education in both religious doctrine and practical skills. A cornerstone of their strategy was the use of the fiesta, which blended Catholic feast days with indigenous cultural traditions to make religious instruction accessible and foster communal unity. Each reduction hosted annual fiestas honoring patron saints, where processions of Jesuits and indigenous villagers were paired with traditional dances, feasts, and craft markets. These fiestas were not merely celebratory; they reinforced the community\u2019s shared identity, taught Catholic values through storytelling and ritual, and gave indigenous people a sense of belonging in a world that often threatened their freedom. Even daily life was structured around small, regular fiestas marking religious milestones, ensuring that faith and community were intertwined at every level of the reduction.\n\nMaintaining these settlements, however, posed formidable challenges for the Jesuits. Foremost among these was hostility from Spanish colonial authorities, who resented that the reducciones removed indigenous labor from the encomienda system, depriving landowners of a critical workforce. Colonial officials often accused the Jesuits of exercising excessive control over the indigenous population, and some even viewed the vibrant fiestas as evidence of this overreach\u2014arguing that the loyalty inspired by these communal events made indigenous villagers more devoted to their Jesuit leaders than to colonial rule. Compounding this tension were frequent Portuguese incursions from Brazil, where bandeirantes raided reducciones to capture slaves, destroying crops and scattering communities. In the face of these raids, the Jesuits relied on fiestas to rally morale: during periods of crisis, they would organize impromptu fiestas to pray for protection, share scarce resources, and remind villagers of their shared purpose. Internal challenges also persisted, including balancing indigenous cultural practices with strict Catholic orthodoxy. While many Jesuits embraced the fusion of traditions in fiestas, some hardline clerics criticized the inclusion of pre-Christian dances or rituals, creating rifts within the religious community. Additionally, economic sustainability was a constant struggle; crop failures, market fluctuations, and competition from colonial plantations often strained the reductions\u2019 self-sufficient systems, making it harder to fund the fiestas that were so vital to community cohesion.\n\nUltimately, the Jesuits\u2019 experiment in Paraguay ended with their expulsion from the Americas in 1767, but their use of the fiesta as a tool for unity and survival remains a defining feature of the reducciones\u2019 legacy. Even amid external pressure and internal strife, the fiesta served as a lifeline, binding indigenous villagers and Jesuit missionaries together in a community that offered both spiritual guidance and protection from the brutalities of colonialism."}

This ensures the breakdown of structure, rhyme scheme, and literary devices is grounded in concrete poetic language:\n\n### Hypothetical Sample Poem: DS Haze\n1. Thumb pads worn thin as rice paper,\n2. The screen glows like a stolen star\u2014\n3. She doesn\u2019t hear the call for dinner,\n4. Her world\u2019s a cartridge, tight and far.\n5. \u201cJust one more level,\u201d she mumbles low,\n6. Fingers dancing, quick as bees,\n7. The DS hums, a secret glow,\n8. Drowning out the family\u2019s pleas.\n9. No more dolls, no outdoor games,\n10. Her eyes stuck to the pixeled frame;\n11. Even dreams are coded names,\n12. A loop she can\u2019t or won\u2019t reclaim.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Structure: Cyclical, Concentrated Stanzas\nThe poem is divided into three 4-line quatrains, each building incrementally on the girl\u2019s obsession to create a narrative arc of escalating entrapment:\n- **Stanza 1** focuses on physical markers of obsession (worn thumb pads, the glowing screen) to establish the tangible cost of her habit.\n- **Stanza 2** shifts to social alienation, showing her ignoring family in favor of the game\u2019s \"secret glow.\"\n- **Stanza 3** culminates in total psychological immersion: she abandons old hobbies, and even her dreams are colonized by the game\u2019s logic.\nThe consistent 4-line stanza length mirrors the repetitive, cyclical nature of gaming (repeating levels, thumb movements), reinforcing how her life has become a rigid, unbroken loop centered on the DS.\n\n### 2. Rhyme Scheme: Predictable Rhymes with Subtle Tension\nThe poem follows an **ABAB rhyme scheme** across all stanzas:\n- Stanza 1: paper (A) / star (B) / dinner (A) / far (B)\n- Stanza 2: low (A) / bees (B) / glow (A) / pleas (B)\n- Stanza 3: games (A) / frame (B) / names (A) / reclaim (B)\nThe predictable, almost mechanical rhyme scheme mimics the monotonous, ritualistic nature of her gaming sessions\u2014each rhyme feels like a repeated button press or level load, emphasizing the obsessive hold the DS has on her routine. In Stanza 3, \"frame\" and \"reclaim\" are slant rhymes (near-rhymes with subtle dissonance), which introduces a note of unease: this dissonance reflects the girl\u2019s subconscious awareness that she is trapped, even as she refuses to break the loop.\n\n### 3. Literary Devices: Anchoring Obsession in Sensory and Emotional Detail\n- **Metaphor**: \"Her world\u2019s a cartridge, tight and far\" compares the DS game to her entire existence, framing her obsession as a form of self-confinement\u2014she has shrunk her life to the small, isolated space of the cartridge, cutting herself off from the \"far\" outside world. \"The screen glows like a stolen star\" casts the DS as a precious, illicit possession she prioritizes over all else, highlighting the intensity of her fixation.\n- **Synecdoche**: \"Thumb pads worn thin as rice paper\" uses a part (her worn thumb pads) to represent the whole of her obsessive behavior. The physical wear is a visible, permanent marker of the hours she has poured into the game, making her obsession tangible.\n- **Personification**: \"The DS hums, a secret glow\" gives the device a voice and a hidden life, framing it as a loyal, exclusive companion that replaces human interaction. This personification explains why the girl prioritizes the DS over her family\u2014she sees it as a confidant rather than a machine.\n- **Visual Imagery**: \"Eyes stuck to the pixeled frame\" creates a vivid mental picture of her unblinking fixation, emphasizing her inability to disengage from the screen. \"Even dreams are coded names\" extends this imagery to her inner life, showing that the game has infiltrated every corner of her consciousness.\n- **Anaphora (implied)**: The repetition of \"no more\" in Stanza 3 (\"No more dolls, no outdoor games\") emphasizes the erasure of her old identity\u2014she has abandoned all previous interests to fully embrace her DS obsession.\n\n---\n\nIn sum, the poem\u2019s structure, rhyme scheme, and literary devices work in tandem to portray the girl\u2019s obsession not just as a hobby, but as a totalizing force that reshapes her body, her relationships, and her sense of self. Each element reinforces the idea that the DS has become both her refuge and her prison.

{"prompt": "Suggest tips for teenagers about how to write a good essay.\n\nWrite a summary after answering the request. These two parts should be separated by 6 asterisk symbols (******).", "response": "### Essay Writing Tips for Teenagers\n1. **Choose a topic with personal stakes**: Even for assigned themes (like \"community\" or \"climate action\"), narrow it to something you care about\u2014e.g., \"How my neighborhood\u2019s lack of a skate park pushed me to organize a fundraiser.\" Personal connection turns writing from a chore into sharing a story that matters.\n2. **Outline to avoid rambling**: Skip rigid templates if they feel restrictive; use a mind map or bullet points to list your thesis, main ideas, and supporting evidence (anecdotes, facts, quotes). This ensures every section ties back to your core argument and keeps your essay focused.\n3. **Hook readers immediately**: Ditch generic openings like \"In this essay, I will discuss...\" Instead, start with a surprising fact, short personal story, or provocative question. For example: \"Last summer, I spent three weeks picking up trash from our local beach\u2014and found 12 pairs of flip-flops, a broken bike, and a letter dated 2019.\"\n4. **Use specific, vivid evidence**: Vague statements (\"Pollution is harmful\") don\u2019t persuade. Replace them with concrete details: \"My little brother\u2019s asthma flared up after we swam in the lake, and the local environmental group confirmed high runoff levels from the nearby farm.\" Specifics make your essay relatable and credible.\n5. **Embrace your authentic voice**: You don\u2019t need to sound like a textbook. Write like you speak (keep it respectful and clear) and avoid big words you don\u2019t fully understand\u2014clarity beats complexity every time.\n6. **Follow the \"PEE\" structure for body paragraphs**: For each main point, state it clearly (Point), provide evidence to back it up (Evidence), and explain how it supports your thesis (Explanation). This flow ensures each paragraph has a clear purpose.\n7. **Revise multiple times**: Your first draft is just a rough sketch. On the second pass, check logical flow. On the third, fix awkward sentences and typos. Read aloud\u2014if it sounds clunky when you say it, it will feel clunky to read. Ask a friend or teacher for fresh feedback.\n8. **End with a memorable conclusion**: Don\u2019t repeat your introduction. Instead, tie ideas together and leave a thought-provoking takeaway\u2014e.g., \"Fixing our neighborhood park isn\u2019t just about having a place to play; it\u2019s about teaching kids their voices can make a difference.\"\n\n******\n### Summary\nThese essay writing tips for teenagers prioritize authenticity and practicality to make the process engaging and less daunting. Key guidance includes narrowing broad topics to those with personal connection to boost motivation, using outlines or mind maps to maintain focus, hooking readers with vivid opening anecdotes or questions, and replacing vague claims with specific, personal evidence to build credibility. Teens are encouraged to embrace their natural voice instead of mimicking formal, unapproachable language, and to structure body paragraphs using the \"Point, Evidence, Explanation\" framework for clarity. Multiple rounds of revision\u2014including reading aloud and seeking feedback\u2014are highlighted as essential for polishing flow and fixing errors, while conclusions should offer meaningful takeaways rather than repetitive restatements of the thesis."}

Your response should be at least 300 words long.", "response": "# The Paris 2024 Women\u2019s Gymnastics All-Around Final: Gold, Grit, and Global Unity  \n\nThe Bercy Arena in Paris hums with electric energy\u2014green and yellow Brazilian flags wave beside red, white, and blue American banners, while Japanese fans hold up hand-painted signs for their rising star. The women\u2019s all-around final is underway, and three gymnasts from different corners of the world are poised to etch their names into Olympic history.  \n\n*The Weight of Legacy: Elara Voss\u2019s Last Chance*  \nAt 24, U.S. gymnast Elara Voss stands backstage, her ankle wrapped in a discreet brace. This is her final Olympics; she took silver in Tokyo, and a chronic ankle injury has threatened to derail her Paris campaign. As she steps onto the uneven bars, the crowd roars. Her routine is a masterclass in precision: giant swings into a double back release, caught cleanly, followed by a dismount that lands her softly on the mat. She winces slightly, pressing a hand to her ankle, but her face lights up\u2014she\u2019s nailed the first of four routines. \u201cThis is for everyone who believed in me when I thought I couldn\u2019t go on,\u201d she whispers to her coach.  \n\n*The Quiet Revolution: Hana Tanaka\u2019s Unconventional Routine*  \nNineteen-year-old Hana Tanaka from Japan is the competition\u2019s most unexpected standout. Trained alongside a traditional kabuki dancer, her floor routine blends acrobatic difficulty with kabuki\u2019s dramatic flair. She glides across the mat, her arms moving in the sharp, deliberate gestures of a kabuki performer, before launching into a triple twist dismount that leaves the crowd gasping. The judges lean forward, their pens hovering over scorecards\u2014this isn\u2019t just a gymnastics routine; it\u2019s a cultural statement. Hana\u2019s coach, a former kabuki actor, wipes a tear from his eye. \u201cWe wanted to show that gymnastics can be both athletic and artistic,\u201d he says.  \n\n*The Underdog\u2019s Roar: Lila Mendes\u2019s Vault of Defiance*  \nBrazil\u2019s Lila Mendes is the dark horse of the final. Two years ago, an ACL tear almost ended her career; she trained in a makeshift gym in her small Manaus hometown, using old mats donated by a local school. Now, she stands at the vault runway, eyes fixed on the apparatus. She charges forward, launches into the air, and executes a Yurchenko double pike\u2014a vault only a handful of gymnasts have attempted in Olympic competition. She sticks the landing, arms raised in triumph. The Brazilian section of the arena erupts, chanting her name. Lila tears up, knowing she\u2019s just defied every odd stacked against her.  \n\n*The Tension in the Arena: Judges\u2019 Scoring and Crowd Reaction*  \nAs the final routines wrap up, the arena falls into a hush. The scoreboard flickers: Elara\u2019s total is 57.232, Hana\u2019s 57.416, Lila\u2019s 56.988. The crowd buzzes\u2014this is the closest all-around final in decades. Japanese fans chant Hana\u2019s name in unison, while American supporters roar for Elara. The judges huddle briefly, reviewing Hana\u2019s beam routine for deductions. When the final score is confirmed, the arena explodes: Hana is in first place, Elara second, Lila third.  \n\n*A Shared Moment of Respect: Post-Competition Embrace*  \nBefore the medal ceremony, the three gymnasts meet near the podium. Elara, known for her fierce competitiveness, pulls Hana into a tight hug. \u201cYour routine was beautiful,\u201d she says, her voice warm and genuine. Lila joins in, her eyes still glistening with tears. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be standing here with you two,\u201d she admits. Hana bows slightly, a traditional Japanese gesture of gratitude. \u201cWe all fought so hard,\u201d she says. In that moment, nationalities fade\u2014they\u2019re just three women who\u2019ve poured their hearts into their sport.  \n\n*The Gold Medal: More Than a Trophy*  \nWhen Hana stands on the top podium, the Japanese national anthem plays. She holds the gold medal to her chest, tears streaming down her face. In her post-medal interview, she says, \u201cThis medal isn\u2019t just for me. It\u2019s for every young girl in Japan who dreams of blending their culture with their passion. Gymnastics isn\u2019t just about difficulty\u2014it\u2019s about telling your story.\u201d Elara, beside her, smiles through her own tears: \u201cI\u2019m sad I didn\u2019t get gold, but I\u2019m proud of how far I came. This journey has been worth every late-night ice bath and every painful rehearsal.\u201d Lila adds, \u201cFor the kids back in Manaus: don\u2019t let anyone tell you your dreams are too big. I\u2019m proof that you can come back stronger than ever.\u201d  \n\n*The Unwritten Rule of Sportsmanship: Beyond the Competition*  \nLater that night, the three gymnasts meet at a cozy caf\u00e9 near the Olympic Village. They laugh as they share stories: Elara\u2019s struggle to hide her ankle injury from the press, Hana\u2019s early-morning kabuki lessons that left her sore, Lila\u2019s makeshift gym where her mom would bring her empanadas during training. They exchange phone numbers, promising to stay in touch. For them, the Olympics wasn\u2019t just about winning a medal\u2014it was about connecting with people who understand the sacrifice, the grit, and the love that goes into being a gymnast.

Avoiding it requires extreme linguistic gymnastics that often backfire: hyper-awareness leads to overcorrection that accidentally introduces more 't's, or rephrasing forces awkward sentences that still slip up. The irony lies in their futile mission: the harder they try to evade 't', the more they fixate on it, making slips inevitable. Worse, their attempts to call each other out for using 't' usually involve the letter themselves, turning criticism into self-incrimination.\n\n---\n\n#### Scene 1: Living Room, 2:00 PM\nTess: Alright, let\u2019s test this no-\u2018t\u2019 game\u2014if you slip, you take the trash out tomorrow.\nTom: Trash?

{"prompt": "Is the company culture of Google different from that of Microsoft?\n\nYour entire response must be wrapped inside double quotation marks.", "response": "\"Yes, Google and Microsoft have distinct company cultures, though both have evolved significantly over time.\n\nGoogle\u2019s culture has long been shaped by a casual, innovation-first ethos rooted in its startup origins. It\u2019s renowned for workplace perks like free gourmet meals, game rooms, and flexible environments designed to spark creativity. Historically, Google encouraged employees to dedicate 20% of their time to side projects\u2014a policy that birthed iconic products like Gmail and AdSense. Its guiding principles (once \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d now \u201cDo the right thing\u201d) prioritize user trust and ethical decision-making, with a focus on disruptive, user-centric innovation that often leans heavily into consumer-facing products. The culture embraces rapid experimentation, even if it means discarding projects that don\u2019t yield quick results.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s culture, by contrast, has undergone a dramatic shift under CEO Satya Nadella, moving from a hierarchical, product-siloed structure to one centered on a \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d and empathy. While it still caters deeply to enterprise clients (with Azure, Office 365, and enterprise Windows solutions as core pillars), it now emphasizes cross-team collaboration and inclusivity. Microsoft\u2019s culture is more structured than Google\u2019s, with a focus on building integrated ecosystem solutions that empower businesses and developers. It places strong emphasis on learning and adaptability, framing failure as a stepping stone to growth. Unlike Google\u2019s 20% time initiative, Microsoft\u2019s innovation often aligns closely with its existing product roadmap and enterprise customer needs.\n\nIn short, while both companies value innovation, Google\u2019s culture leans into casual, consumer-focused disruption, while Microsoft\u2019s is more structured, enterprise-aligned, and rooted in collaborative ecosystem building.\""}

{"prompt": "Explain the challenges of racing in such conditions.\n\nYour answer should contain exactly 3 bullet points in markdown format.", "response": "- **Traction and handling instability**: Wet or slippery track surfaces drastically reduce tire grip, leading to frequent understeer (where the car fails to turn as intended) or oversteer (rear-end skids). Braking distances can double or triple, increasing the risk of rear-ending other vehicles, and hydroplaning\u2014where tires lose contact with the track entirely\u2014can cause sudden, uncontrollable slides. Drivers must make minute, constant adjustments to throttle, steering, and braking inputs, which is mentally exhausting and raises the chance of human error.\n- **Severe visibility limitations**: Dense spray kicked up by leading cars can obscure the track ahead, making it nearly impossible to see corners, curbs, or even nearby vehicles. In heavy rain or fog, visibility can drop to just a few meters, forcing drivers to rely on memory of the track layout rather than visual cues. Glare from headlights in low-light conditions or reflections off wet surfaces further distorts vision, delaying reaction times and increasing the likelihood of collisions or off-track excursions.\n- **Increased mechanical stress and reliability risks**: Harsh racing conditions put extreme strain on vehicle components. Brake systems can become waterlogged, reducing their effectiveness, or overheat from repeated, aggressive use to compensate for poor traction. Wet tires wear unevenly if not managed properly, and moisture can seep into electrical systems, causing malfunctions like faulty sensors or engine misfires. Teams must balance quick pit stops for tire changes or component adjustments with maintaining race position, as even a small mechanical failure can end a driver\u2019s race prematurely."}

{"prompt": "Describe an awkward situation involving anarchists in Tulsa.\n\nYour response should be divided into 3 sections. Mark the beginning of each section with SECTION X.", "response": "SECTION 1: The Accidental Invitation\nThe Tulsa Anarchist Collective (TAC) had spent six months turning a weedy vacant lot near the Blue Dome District into a thriving community garden, operating entirely on consensus-based decisions, no formal leaders, and zero interaction with city government. To celebrate their first harvest of heirloom tomatoes and okra, they planned a \"No Bosses, No Bills\" potluck, where everyone would bring a dish made from locally foraged or homegrown ingredients. A newer member, 19-year-old Milo, tasked with designing flyers, wanted to make them accessible, so he added a QR code linking to the collective\u2019s decentralized discussion board. But in a sleep-deprived haze, he scanned the wrong code\u2014one he\u2019d saved for a city-sponsored \"Sustainable Tulsa\" workshop\u2014and printed it on 50 flyers. By the time the mistake was caught, the flyers were taped to lampposts, coffee shop bulletin boards, and the side of a food truck downtown. On potluck day, along with the usual crowd of patch-jacketed punks and permaculture enthusiasts, three city officials showed up: Gary, the head of Parks and Recreation, his assistant, and a city councilor, all clutching branded water bottles and clipboards.\n\nSECTION 2: The Clash of Ideologies and Deviled Eggs\nThe awkwardness set in immediately when Gary approached the collective\u2019s informal spokesperson (though no one would admit she was a spokesperson) and said, \"Great to see the city\u2019s sustainable initiatives gaining traction with grassroots groups!\" Lila, who\u2019d spent three hours arguing against installing a lock on the garden gate (since locks are \"hierarchical tools of exclusion\"), stared at him for a full 10 seconds before sputtering, \"We\u2019re not affiliated with the city. We don\u2019t believe in governments.\" Gary, unfazed, nodded and said, \"Of course, community input is key\u2014we just want to talk about how we can support your work with grants and fence materials.\" This sparked an immediate, hushed debate among the anarchists: half argued that accepting any city support would compromise their anti-state principles, while the other half pointed to the deer that had eaten 80% of their squash the week prior. Meanwhile, the city councilor wandered over to the potluck table, picked up a jar of fermented cabbage, and asked, \"Is this locally sourced?\" When Milo explained it was foraged from an abandoned grocery store\u2019s produce section, the councilor\u2019s smile faded. The suburban moms who\u2019d tagged along with the officials started asking about volunteer sign-up sheets, which the collective didn\u2019t have\u2014they believed in spontaneous participation, not formal commitments. One mom tried to organize a \"sign-up list for snack rotations,\" only to be told by a TAC member, \"We don\u2019t do lists. If you want to bring snacks, bring snacks. If not, don\u2019t.\" The mom looked confused and retreated to her car.\n\nSECTION 3: The Consensus Hangover\nBy the time the city officials left (politely promising to \"send over grant applications\"), the potluck had fizzled. The collective gathered in a circle for a consensus meeting to address the flyer mistake and the debate over city support. Milo, guilt-ridden, tried to apologize, but the group insisted on an \"accountability circle\" where everyone shared their feelings instead of letting him take blame. For two hours, members talked about \"the tension between accessibility and ideological purity\" and \"the dangers of state co-optation.\" No clear decision was reached\u2014they agreed to table the fence discussion until their next meeting, which would be held at 7 PM the following Tuesday (though no one wrote it down, since calendars are \"tools of capitalist time control\"). The awkwardness lingered for weeks: the city kept sending emails to a fake address Milo had set up, the suburban moms kept inviting TAC members to their \"Sustainable Parenting\" workshops, and the deer kept coming back to eat their remaining crops. The collective\u2019s only tangible resolution was to make new flyers with handwritten URLs instead of QR codes, and to add a big, spray-painted note at the bottom: \"NO CITY OFFICIALS ALLOWED. NO BOSSES. NO BULLSHIT.\""}
{"prompt": "Explain how to maintain balance while pedaling a bike.\n\nYour response should not include the keywords \"slow\", \"like\" and \"kid\".", "response": "To maintain balance while pedaling a bike, start with intentional body positioning. Engage your core muscles to keep your torso stable, avoiding excessive sway or slouching. Rest your hands lightly but firmly on the handlebars\u2014over-gripping can induce tension that disrupts natural adjustments. Keep your weight centered evenly over the bike\u2019s frame, not shifted too far forward toward the handlebars or backward toward the seat.\n\nSustained forward motion plays a critical role. As you pedal, the spinning wheels generate a gyroscopic force that inherently stabilizes the bike. Maintain a consistent pedaling cadence, with smooth, even strokes rather than erratic bursts of speed or abrupt pauses. This steady motion keeps the stabilizing force active and prevents sudden shifts in momentum that could unbalance you.\n\nVisual focus is another key element. Fix your gaze on a point several meters ahead of your bike, rather than staring at the ground directly in front of the wheels. This helps your subconscious adjust your body and handlebar position to stay on a straight, balanced path, as your eyes guide your body\u2019s natural alignment.\n\nWhen navigating turns or uneven terrain, make gradual, controlled adjustments. For turns, lean your torso in the same direction as the bike, aligning your center of gravity with the bike\u2019s lean angle instead of just twisting the handlebars. This keeps your weight balanced over the bike\u2019s contact points with the ground. On rough surfaces, bend your knees slightly to absorb shocks, which prevents stiffening up and losing control. Avoid sudden movements\u2014such as jerking the handlebars, slamming on brakes, or shifting weight abruptly\u2014all of which can throw off your balance by disrupting your center of gravity.\n\nRegular practice helps refine these instincts, allowing you to respond automatically to changes in terrain or momentum without conscious effort. Over time, your body learns to sync its movements with the bike\u2019s dynamics, making balance feel intuitive and effortless."}

Divide both sides by 2: \\( y = \\frac{x - 3}{2} \\)\n\n### Step 4: Replace \\( y \\) with \\( f^{-1}(x) \\)\nUse inverse function notation to explicitly identify the result as the inverse of \\( f(x) \\).  \nFor our example:  \n\\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - 3}{2} \\)\n\n### Step 5: Verify the inverse (optional but recommended)\nTo confirm correctness, check that both \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \\) and \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) = x \\):  \n1. Calculate \\( f(f^{-1}(x)) \\):  \n\\( f\\left(\\frac{x - 3}{2}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{x - 3}{2}\\right) + 3 = (x - 3) + 3 = x \\)  \n2. Calculate \\( f^{-1}(f(x)) \\):  \n\\( f^{-1}(2x + 3) = \\frac{(2x + 3) - 3}{2} = \\frac{2x}{2} = x \\)\n\nBoth checks confirm that \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - 3}{2} \\) is indeed the valid inverse of \\( f(x) = 2x + 3 \\)."}

Judges award prizes for \"Most Creative Use of Office Supplies\" (think a stapler repurposed as a medieval sword), \"Best Backstory\" (the time-traveling librarian\u2019s desk has \"ancient\" sticky notes from 2021), and \"Coziest Nook.\" This lets coworkers peek into each other\u2019s personalities without pressure and sparks casual, fun conversations.\n\n2. **Office Legend Story Slam**  \n   Invite coworkers to craft and perform 2-minute \"office legends\"\u2014either exaggerated true tales (like the time the breakroom microwave started singing off-key \"Happy Birthday\") or completely fictional but relatable ones (how the office plant secretly judges our coffee orders). The audience votes for \"Most Dramatic Performance,\" \"Funniest Plot Twist,\" and \"Most Plausible Lie.\" This turns inside jokes into shared entertainment and encourages storytelling without being mean-spirited.\n\n3. **Reverse Trivia Battle**  \n   Instead of answering questions, participants invent the silliest, most creative question that leads to a given answer. For example, if the answer is \"Stapler,\" someone might ask, \"What\u2019s the tiny metal hero that holds our chaotic meeting agendas together (until someone accidentally jams it)?\" Prizes go to the \"Most Absurd Question,\" \"Most Relatable Office Scenario,\" and \"Punniest Wordplay.\" It flips traditional trivia on its head, letting people lean into their silly side rather than stressing about being \"right.\"\n\n4. **Collaborative Mural Mashup**  \n   Split the office into small teams, give each a section of a large canvas, random supplies (crayons, stickers, tape, old magazine clippings), and a mandatory item to include (e.g., a coffee cup, rubber duck, printer). Teams have 30 minutes to create their section, then everyone gathers to see how all pieces fit into one chaotic, wonderful mural. Prizes for \"Best Integration of the Mandatory Item,\" \"Most Cohesive Whole Mural,\" and \"Most Unexpected Masterpiece.\" This fosters teamwork and celebrates diverse creative ideas.\n\n5. **Office Chair Obstacle Course Relay**  \n   Set up a low-stakes obstacle course using office furniture: weave around cubicles, pass a ping-pong ball between teammates while sitting in rolling chairs, and \"park\" your chair without knocking over a stack of paper cups. Teams of two compete, with prizes for \"Fastest Time,\" \"Least Number of Accidents,\" and \"Most Dramatic (But Harmless) Crash.\" It\u2019s a physical, silly activity that gets people laughing and collaborating without athletic pressure.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?"}

It made me smile for a second, then my chest tightened because I realized it\u2019s been three weeks since we sat here together, laughing about how the guy at the next table always reads his newspaper out loud to his dog. I know you\u2019ve been going through something unthinkable lately, and I haven\u2019t pushed you to talk because I don\u2019t want to add any more weight to your shoulders. But I need you to know: I see you. I see the way your texts are shorter, the way you cancel plans last minute not because you don\u2019t want to be around me, but because getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. I see the redness around your eyes when we do meet, and I don\u2019t say anything because sometimes silence is more kind than any words I could muster.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be strong for me, Lila. You don\u2019t have to pretend that everything is fine, or that you\u2019re \u201cgetting over it\u201d faster than you are. Grief, heartbreak, whatever this heavy thing is that\u2019s sitting in your chest\u2014they don\u2019t have an expiration date. There\u2019s no rulebook that says you have to feel better by a certain time, and I will never, ever judge you for taking as long as you need. If you want to sit on my couch and cry for hours, I\u2019ll hand you tissues and make you hot cocoa with extra marshmallows. If you want to drive around aimlessly and blast that terrible 2000s pop playlist we made in college, I\u2019ll sing off-key even if my voice cracks. If you want to say nothing at all and just watch reruns of that silly reality show we used to love, I\u2019ll bring the popcorn (and this time, I won\u2019t burn it).\n\nI know it might feel like the joy has been sucked out of the world right now, like every day is just a series of tasks to check off until you can go back to bed. But I want to gently suggest some tiny, almost insignificant things that might help you catch a glimmer of it, if you\u2019re open to it. You don\u2019t have to do all of them, or any of them\u2014this is just a list of little things that have helped me when I was stuck in a dark place, and I thought I\u2019d share.\n\nFirst, remember how you used to doodle little stars and flowers in the margins of every notebook you owned? I found one of your old sketchbooks when I was cleaning out my closet last week\u2014the one with the neon pink cover\u2014and I flipped through it, and I smiled because every page was full of your messy, perfect little drawings. Maybe tonight, you could grab a pen and a piece of paper and just draw whatever comes to mind, even if it\u2019s just a squiggle. You don\u2019t have to show anyone, and it doesn\u2019t have to be good. It\u2019s just about letting your hands move without overthinking, about reconnecting with a part of yourself that used to create just for the sake of creating.\n\nSecond, try to notice one small, good thing each day. It could be something as simple as the way the sunlight filters through your kitchen window in the morning, or the taste of a ripe strawberry, or the sound of a bird singing outside your window. Write it down on a sticky note and stick it to your fridge. At first, it might feel forced, like you\u2019re grasping at straws, but after a few days, you might start noticing more of these little moments without even trying. They won\u2019t erase the hard parts, but they can remind you that the world isn\u2019t all bad\u2014that there are still tiny pockets of warmth even when everything feels cold.\n\nThird, think about a tiny way you could connect with someone or something outside of your own pain. Last month, when I was feeling low, I started bringing my neighbor\u2019s trash can up to their porch every Tuesday night. It was such a small thing, but when they left me a jar of homemade jam on my doorstep, I felt a little less alone, like I was part of something bigger than my own sadness. Maybe you could volunteer at the animal shelter downtown for an hour once a week\u2014you\u2019ve always loved dogs, and I know they\u2019d light up when you walk in, their tails wagging like you\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to them. Or you could send a text to an old friend you haven\u2019t talked to in a while, just saying \u201cI thought of you today.\u201d Sometimes, giving a little bit of kindness can help you feel a little more connected to the world, and that connection can bring a sense of meaning that\u2019s hard to find when you\u2019re stuck in your own head.\n\nFourth, move your body in a way that feels good, not like a chore. You don\u2019t have to go to the gym or run a mile\u2014just put on a song you love and dance around your living room for five minutes, or take a slow walk around the block after dinner. The fresh air and movement can help release some of the tension in your body, and even if it doesn\u2019t make you feel happy, it might make you feel a little lighter, if only for a minute. I remember how you used to love walking through the park in the fall, kicking up the leaves and collecting the prettiest ones to press in books. Maybe we could do that this weekend, if you\u2019re up for it\u2014no pressure, just slow steps and crunchy leaves.\n\nI want you to know that none of these things are meant to fix you, because you don\u2019t need fixing. You\u2019re going through a hard time, and that\u2019s okay. These are just small, gentle ways to remind yourself that you\u2019re still here, that you still have the capacity to feel joy, even if it\u2019s buried under a lot of pain. You don\u2019t have to \u201cget back to normal\u201d right now\u2014normal will come when it\u2019s ready, and it might even be a new, better normal than before.\n\nI\u2019m going to leave this letter on your doorstep tomorrow, along with that lavender latte and a copy of your favorite book\u2014the one with the dog on the cover that you\u2019ve read a hundred times. I won\u2019t knock, so you don\u2019t have to worry about putting on a brave face. If you want to call me later, I\u2019ll be by the phone, no matter how late it is. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s okay too. I\u2019ll check in again in a few days, with your favorite chocolate chip cookies (the ones with extra sea salt, just how you like them).\n\nYou are not alone in this, Lila. You are loved, you are seen, and you are so much stronger than you think\u2014even when you don\u2019t feel strong at all. I\u2019m here, for every messy, hard, beautiful, quiet moment. I\u2019ll never tire of showing up for you, no matter how long this takes.\n\nWith all my love,\nMia"}

Your parents might even be impressed (and maybe say yes).\n5. Reading lets you have adventures without leaving your bedroom. You can climb a mountain, sail across a sea of candy, or join a band of pirates who only sing show tunes\u2014all while sitting in your pajamas, eating popcorn. No need to pack a bag, no need to ask for permission, no need to worry about getting lost.

{"prompt": "Describe the common symptoms that a woman may experience if ovarian cancer has spread to the abdomen and pelvic region, including bloating, pain, changes in bowel habits, urinary issues, loss of appetite, fatigue, and weight loss.\n\nYour response should be wrapped with double quotation marks. The answer should be 600+ words long. Your response should be in lower case letters.", "response": "\"when ovarian cancer spreads to the abdomen and pelvic region, the symptoms become far more noticeable and persistent, often overlapping and worsening as tumors grow, press on nearby organs, or trigger systemic changes in the body. one of the most common and early signs of advanced ovarian cancer is persistent bloating, a symptom that differs drastically from the occasional, mild bloating many people experience after a large meal or hormonal fluctuations. this bloating is caused by ascites\u2014an accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity that occurs when cancer cells irritate the lining of the abdomen, preventing the body from properly absorbing fluid. over time, the fluid builds up, causing a tight, swollen feeling in the abdomen that doesn\u2019t ease with over-the-counter remedies, dietary changes, or bowel movements. people may notice their waistbands feel tight even if their overall weight hasn\u2019t increased, and the bloating can be constant or worsen throughout the day, often accompanied by a dull, heavy sensation in the lower abdomen. as the fluid accumulates, it presses on adjacent organs like the stomach, bladder, and intestines, exacerbating other symptoms such as loss of appetite and urinary issues.\n\nalongside bloating, persistent pelvic and abdominal pain is a hallmark symptom of ovarian cancer that has spread to the pelvic region. this pain arises from several sources: growing tumors can press on pelvic nerves, irritate the lining of the abdomen, or invade nearby organs like the uterus, bladder, or rectum. the pain may present as a dull, achy throb localized to the lower abdomen or pelvis, or it can be sharp and intermittent, worsening with movement, sexual intercourse, or bowel movements. for some people, the pain radiates to the lower back, as tumors press on the spinal nerves that run through the pelvic area. unlike temporary pain from a menstrual cramp or a urinary tract infection, this pain is persistent, lasting for weeks or months, and gradually becomes more severe as the cancer progresses.\n\nchanges in bowel habits are another common symptom when ovarian cancer spreads to the abdomen, as tumors often press on the colon or rectum, disrupting normal digestive function. these changes can manifest as chronic constipation, diarrhea, or an alternating pattern between the two, and they typically last for more than a few days\u2014unlike the temporary bowel upset caused by food poisoning or a virus. many people also experience a feeling of incomplete bowel movement (tenesmus), where they feel like they need to use the bathroom but can\u2019t fully empty their rectum, or notice narrow, pencil-like stools due to the pressure of tumors on the colon. in some cases, the irritation from tumors can lead to bleeding during bowel movements, which may appear as bright red blood in the stool or dark, tarry stools if the bleeding is higher up in the digestive tract.\n\nurinary issues are closely linked to pelvic spread, as tumors press on the bladder or ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder). this pressure can cause frequent urination, even when the bladder is not full, or a sudden, urgent need to urinate that can\u2019t be ignored. some people may struggle with difficulty urinating, a weak urine stream, or even urinary retention, where they can\u2019t empty their bladder at all. in more advanced cases, tumors may invade the bladder wall, leading to blood in the urine (hematuria), which can be visible or detected only through a urine test. these urinary symptoms are not relieved by antibiotics (unlike a urinary tract infection) and persist or worsen over time, often disrupting sleep and daily activities.\n\nloss of appetite is a systemic symptom that often accompanies advanced ovarian cancer, driven by multiple factors. the buildup of ascitic fluid can press on the stomach, making people feel full after eating only a small amount of food, even if they haven\u2019t eaten in hours. additionally, cancer cells release chemical signals that suppress the body\u2019s hunger hormones, reducing the desire to eat. many people also experience nausea or vomiting, either from the pressure on the stomach or from toxins released by the cancer, further discouraging them from eating. this loss of appetite leads to inadequate nutrient intake, which in turn fuels other symptoms like fatigue and weight loss.\n\nfatigue is one of the most debilitating symptoms of advanced ovarian cancer, affecting nearly everyone with the disease at this stage. it is not the tiredness that can be relieved by a good night\u2019s sleep; instead, it is a profound, overwhelming exhaustion that lingers even after rest. this fatigue stems from several causes: the cancer cells consume a significant portion of the body\u2019s energy reserves, leaving little for normal bodily functions; nutrient deficiencies from loss of appetite lead to weakness; anemia (a low red blood cell count) caused by bleeding or the cancer\u2019s effect on bone marrow reduces the body\u2019s ability to carry oxygen to tissues; and sleep disturbances from pain, frequent urination, or anxiety. this fatigue can make even simple tasks like getting dressed, walking to the bathroom, or talking to others feel impossible, drastically reducing quality of life.\n\nunintentional weight loss is another key symptom, often occurring alongside loss of appetite and fatigue. even if someone is not trying to lose weight, they may notice a steady drop in their weight over weeks or months. this weight loss is not just from eating less; cancer cells alter the body\u2019s metabolism, breaking down muscle and fat tissue for energy, even when the person is consuming enough calories. some people may appear to gain weight due to ascitic fluid buildup in the abdomen, but their actual muscle mass and body fat are decreasing, leading to a gaunt appearance in the face, arms, and legs. this weight loss further weakens the body, making it harder to tolerate treatments and increasing the risk of infections and other complications.\n\ntogether, these symptoms paint a picture of advanced ovarian cancer that has spread beyond the ovaries, and while many of them are non-specific (meaning they can be caused by other, less serious conditions), their persistence and combination should prompt immediate medical attention. early detection of advanced ovarian cancer can improve treatment outcomes, so anyone experiencing these symptoms for more than two weeks should consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation.\""}

For example:\n\nSection 1\n***\nSection 2\n\nYou should use words with all capital letters for at least 2 times.", "response": "Section 1: The \"Zero-Judgment\" Brain Dump Phase\nBefore you start drafting any structured content, commit to a 15-minute BRAINSTORM WITHOUT CENSORSHIP. Write every thought, question, or half-formed idea related to your topic\u2014ignore grammar, spelling, or whether the thought makes \"sense\" in the moment. This process primes your brain to connect ideas freely, eliminates the pressure of starting with a blank page, and ensures you don\u2019t overlook unexpected, creative angles that could make your writing unique. The goal here isn\u2019t to produce polished text; it\u2019s to build a raw, rich pool of material to draw from in later stages.\n\n***\nSection 2: Iterative Drafting with Focused Micro-Revisions\nInstead of trying to write a perfect draft in one go, break the revision process into targeted, single-task passes. This keeps you from feeling overwhelmed and ensures you address each aspect of your writing with intentionality:\n* After your initial draft, set a 20-minute timer and revise ONLY for logical flow. Move entire paragraphs, add transition sentences, or cut tangents\u2014don\u2019t waste time on spelling or word choice. Ask yourself: Does each idea lead naturally to the next? If not, rearrange or bridge the gap immediately.\n* On your second pass, focus exclusively on voice consistency. Every sentence should align with the tone you want to convey (formal, conversational, persuasive). Cut any phrases that feel out of place, even if they\u2019re well-written\u2014UNITY OF VOICE is critical to keeping readers engaged from start to finish.\n* For your third pass, do line-level edits backward: start at the last sentence and work your way to the first. This trick prevents your brain from skimming (since you know the content) and makes it easier to catch awkward phrasing, redundant words, or grammatical errors you\u2019d miss when reading forward.\n\n***\nSection 3: The Subconscious Reflection Break\nOnce you\u2019ve completed your revised draft, step away from your writing for at least 24 hours\u2014longer if you can. This isn\u2019t a lazy detour; it\u2019s a core part of the process. Your brain needs time to process the content subconsciously, so when you return, you\u2019ll notice flaws (like a weak thesis or underdeveloped argument) or opportunities (like a way to make a conclusion more impactful) that were invisible when you were deep in the drafting grind. This break helps you approach your work with fresh eyes, making your final revisions more effective.\n\n***\nSection 4: The Read-Aloud Final Check\nThe last step in refining your writing is to read the entire piece aloud, slowly and with expression. This process forces you to engage with your writing as a reader would, not as the writer who knows every intended meaning. You\u2019ll stumble over awkward sentence structures, catch run-on phrases, and identify gaps in logic that silent reading misses. If a sentence feels clunky when spoken, it will feel clunky to your readers\u2014rewrite it until it flows naturally. This final check ensures your writing is clear, compelling, and ready to share with your audience."}

I stand on the rotting wooden dock, my boots sinking into warped planks, and try to hear the echo of our laughter\u2014once so loud it bounced off the water and tangled in the willow branches. The cousins used to race each other to the weathered buoy, bare feet slapping the lake\u2019s surface, then collapse on the shore to share stolen peach pie, crumbs sticking to our sunburned cheeks.  \n\nNow, the cousins are scattered like dandelion seeds across the country: some have kids who\u2019ve never heard of this place, others too swamped with jobs and broken marriages to answer a simple text. Last winter, when Grandma passed\u2014the woman who baked that peach pie, who\u2019d gathered us every summer\u2014the cousins tried to meet for her funeral, but half of us missed it due to snowstorms and delayed flights. That\u2019s when I felt the final thread holding us together snap.  \n\nThe house creaks in the wind, as if it\u2019s mourning the absence of the cousins who once ran through its halls, chasing fireflies and drawing on walls with crayons. I run my fingers over the initials we carved into the porch post: all the cousins\u2019 names, scrawled in wobbly, ink-stained letters when we were seven or ten. Now, those initials are faded, almost unrecognizable, just like the memories we used to cling to like lifelines.  \n\nNo one wanted to take the house; it felt too heavy, too full of ghosts of the cousins who\u2019d grown up there, who\u2019d cried and laughed and dreamed within its walls. I pick up a smooth stone from the shore\u2014the same kind we\u2019d skip across the lake for hours as kids\u2014and toss it into the water. It sinks without a splash, just like the days when the cousins were all together, when summer felt endless and we thought we\u2019d never grow apart.  \n\nTomorrow, I\u2019ll drive back to my small city apartment, and the bulldozers will arrive, erasing the last physical piece of the world where the cousins were still a family. By next month, there\u2019ll be nothing left but a patch of dirt, and the only thing we\u2019ll have left of those summers are faded phone photos and the quiet ache of missing the cousins who once were everything to us."}

{"prompt": "Provide a detailed report on the investigation process that the police are undertaking to solve the mysterious death, including potential evidence collection methods, witness interviews, and analysis of the crime scene.\n\nYour response should not mention the following keywords: \"story\", \"killer\", \"dead\", \"found\", \"law\", \"room\", \"kill\", \"result\", \"use\", \"approach\", \"people\", \"president\".", "response": "# Investigation Process Report: Unexplained Fatal Incident  \nThis report outlines the systematic procedures being executed by local investigative authorities to resolve an unexplained fatal incident. The process follows a structured, multi-phase framework to preserve integrity, gather actionable insights, and test hypotheses about the circumstances surrounding the event.\n\n## 1. Scene Securing and Initial Assessment  \nUpon notification of the incident, uniformed personnel deployed immediately to establish a restricted perimeter around the affected area, using barricades and visible markers to prevent unauthorized access. Lead investigators and forensic specialists conducted a preliminary walkthrough before any disturbance of the scene, documenting spatial relationships, environmental conditions (temperature, lighting, air quality), and anomalous elements that deviated from normal circumstances. Key observations included signs of potential tampering with external entry points, unusual residual odors, and items positioned in ways that conflicted with typical usage patterns.\n\n## 2. Evidence Collection Methods  \nInvestigators employ specialized techniques to gather and preserve evidence without compromising its integrity:  \n- **Physical Trace Retrieval**: Sterile gloves, tweezers, and sealed evidence bags are used to collect fibers, hair, soil particles, and residual substances on surfaces. Filtered vacuum equipment targets specific zones to capture microscopic debris, which is transferred to labeled containers for laboratory analysis. Footwear and tire track impressions are cast using dental stone, with careful attention to avoid distorting original patterns.  \n- **Digital Evidence Acquisition**: Electronic devices present at the scene (mobile devices, laptops, surveillance cameras) are seized and transported to a secure digital forensics lab. Specialists extract communication logs, location history, and timestamped media, bypassing encryption protocols where necessary while maintaining an unbroken chain of custody.  \n- **Biological Sample Processing**: Bodily fluid samples (if detected) are collected via swabs and stored in temperature-controlled containers to prevent degradation. These samples are dispatched for DNA profiling and toxicological screening to identify foreign substances or matches to profiles in national databases.  \n- **Materials Analysis**: Paint chips, glass fragments, and metal shavings are submitted to a materials science lab for compositional testing, which helps trace their origin and potential connection to the incident.\n\n## 3. Witness Engagement and Statement Corroboration  \nInvestigators identify and engage with individuals holding potential knowledge of the incident or the victim\u2019s recent activities. These individuals are categorized by their proximity to the scene during the estimated time of the event, frequency of contact with the victim, or observations of unusual behavior in the surrounding area. Interviews occur in private, non-coercive settings, with open-ended questions designed to elicit detailed, chronological accounts. All interactions are recorded with explicit consent, and statements are cross-referenced to identify inconsistencies or corroborating details. Leads such as unfamiliar vehicles, unannounced visitors, or shifts in the victim\u2019s daily routine are prioritized for follow-up.\n\n## 4. Forensic Analysis and Hypothesis Testing  \nForensic pathologists conduct a comprehensive examination of the victim\u2019s remains to identify signs of trauma, underlying conditions, or exposure to harmful substances. Preliminary observations guide toxicological testing, which screens for a wide range of chemical compounds. DNA analysts compare trace samples from the scene to local and national database profiles, while digital specialists reconstruct timelines of electronic activity to identify deleted communications or suspicious network connections. Crime scene reconstruction teams use 3D scanning technology to create an interactive model of the area, allowing investigators to test hypotheses about event sequences, object trajectories, and movement patterns within the space.\n\n## 5. Ongoing and Future Procedures  \nInvestigative authorities continue to coordinate with local businesses and residential communities to gather additional surveillance footage and witness accounts. They collaborate with specialized units to trace the origin of unusual substances or physical evidence collected. Regular case briefings are held to review new observations, adjust priorities, and ensure all leads are pursued in a timely manner. A dedicated tip line has been established to encourage anonymous submissions of information that may assist in resolving the incident."}

Use technical terms sparingly to make the explanation more accessible.\n\nYour entire response must be in English and contain only lowercase letters.", "response": "a 4-stroke motor is a common type of engine that turns fuel into the power needed to run things like cars, lawnmowers, or small generators. it works in four repeating steps, or \"strokes,\" each focused on a piston that slides up and down inside a hollow tube called a cylinder. here\u2019s how each step unfolds:\n\nfirst, the intake stroke. the piston moves down, creating empty space inside the cylinder. this vacuum pulls in a mix of air and fuel (like gasoline) through a small opening that opens just for this moment. once the piston reaches the bottom of the cylinder, the opening closes to trap the air-fuel mix inside.\n\nnext, the compression stroke. the piston slides back up, squishing the air-fuel mix into a tiny, tight space. compressing the mix makes it much more energetic\u2014similar to squeezing a rubber band so it can snap with force later. by the time the piston hits the top of the cylinder, the mix is packed tightly and ready to release its energy.\n\nthen comes the power stroke, which is where the engine generates its driving force. a small spark from a spark plug ignites the compressed air-fuel mix. the mix burns rapidly, creating a quick burst of heat and pressure that pushes the piston back down with significant force. this downward movement turns the engine\u2019s central shaft, which eventually transfers power to the wheels of a car or the blades of a lawnmower, for example.\n\nfinally, the exhaust stroke. the piston moves up again, pushing out the leftover gases from the burned fuel through another small opening that opens now. once the piston reaches the top, this opening closes, and the entire cycle restarts with the intake stroke.\n\nthese four strokes repeat hundreds or even thousands of times every minute, creating a steady flow of power to keep the motor running smoothly."}

{"prompt": "Provide tips for avoiding intra-team conflict. Write the tips in a calm and professional tone suitable for a coaching manual.\n\nYour response must be written in all capital letters, with no lowercase letters.", "response": "# TIPS FOR AVOIDING INTRA-TEAM CONFLICT  \n(For Coaching Manual Use)\n\n1. ESTABLISH CLEAR, TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS  \nDefine standardized channels for sharing updates, asking questions, and escalating concerns (e.g., project management tools for task updates, scheduled meetings for strategic discussions). Use specific, objective language in all communications to eliminate ambiguity and reduce misinterpretation. Ensure all team members understand and agree to these protocols.\n\n2. DOCUMENT ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES, AND DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY  \nCollaboratively create a shared document outlining individual and collective team roles, including ownership of specific tasks, approval hierarchies, and boundaries for overlapping work. This eliminates confusion over who is accountable for what, reducing turf-related conflicts and frustration from unclarity.\n\n3. FOSTER ACTIVE LISTENING AS A NON-NEGOTIABLE TEAM NORM  \nTrain team members to practice active listening: listen fully without interrupting, paraphrase others\u2019 statements to confirm understanding, and ask clarifying questions before responding. Encourage the team to prioritize understanding perspectives over immediately advocating for their own.\n\n4. CULTIVATE EMPATHY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY  \nRegularly remind the team to consider colleagues\u2019 workloads, backgrounds, and personal contexts during interactions. Create an environment where members feel safe to voice dissenting opinions, admit mistakes, and ask for help without fear of judgment or retaliation. Leaders should model this behavior by sharing their own challenges and seeking input openly.\n\n5. CONDUCT PROACTIVE, STRUCTURED TEAM CHECK-INS  \nHold consistent one-on-one and group meetings to discuss progress, surface emerging concerns, and celebrate small wins. These check-ins provide a dedicated forum to address minor tensions before they escalate into full-blown conflicts. Use agenda templates to keep discussions focused and productive.\n\n6. DELIVER CONSTRUCTIVE, SOLUTION-FOCUSED FEEDBACK  \nFrame feedback around specific behaviors and their impact, rather than personal traits. For example, say, \u201cWhen task updates are submitted late, it delays the entire team\u2019s workflow\u2014let\u2019s brainstorm how to adjust timelines to prevent this\u201d instead of criticizing the individual. Focus on collaborative problem-solving rather than blame.\n\n7. CO-CREATE A CLEAR CONFLICT RESOLUTION PROCESS  \nWork with the team to develop a step-by-step protocol for resolving conflicts: start with a private, direct conversation between involved parties; if unresolved, escalate to a neutral mediator or team lead; and document outcomes to prevent recurrence. Ensure all members understand and commit to following this process.\n\n8. ALIGN THE TEAM AROUND SHARED GOALS AND VALUES  \nRegularly revisit and reinforce the team\u2019s overarching objectives and core values. Emphasize that individual success is tied to collective success, encouraging collaboration over competition. Use team-building activities to strengthen shared purpose and mutual respect.\n\n9. ADDRESS MICRO-CONFLICTS IMMEDIATELY  \nLeaders and team members should not ignore small tensions (e.g., passive-aggressive comments, missed commitments). Address these issues privately and promptly with calm, respectful dialogue to prevent them from festering into larger, more damaging conflicts.\n\n10. MODEL RESPECTFUL, PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR FROM LEADERSHIP  \nTeam leaders must consistently demonstrate the behaviors they expect from the team: active listening, empathy, transparent communication, and accountability. Leaders who model respect set a tone that discourages conflict and fosters a culture of collaboration."}

She called out, her meow small and shaky, but no one answered. The sparrow had vanished too, leaving her all by herself in a neighborhood she didn\u2019t recognize.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, the sun was high in the sky, and Mochi\u2019s tongue felt dry and sticky. She wandered down a street lined with tall, narrow houses, each with a different colored door and potted flowers on the step, but none of them looked like her new home. *By dusk, the unfamiliar streets stretched out like a maze, each brick wall and cracked sidewalk looking identical to the last.* She tried to retrace her steps, counting the lampposts as she went, but the dandelion patch was nowhere to be found. The air grew cooler, and Mochi\u2019s fur stood on end as she heard distant barking from a dog tied up in a yard. She hugged the wall, staying as far away as possible.\n\n*A group of strays hissed at her from an alley corner, their eyes glinting in the streetlight, so she fled to the safety of an oak tree\u2019s low branches.* The tree\u2019s bark was rough against her belly, but it was better than facing the unfriendly strays. She curled up tight, tucking her tail around her body, and tried to sleep, but every creak of the wind or rustle of leaves made her jump. She thought about her warm, fuzzy bed back home, the way her owner would scratch her chin before bedtime, and her eyes filled with tears that dripped onto the bark below.\n\n*She woke at dawn to the smell of fresh bread wafting from a corner bakery, her stomach growling so loud it scared a nearby squirrel that was rummaging through a trash can.* She\u2019d eaten nothing since the half bowl of chicken kibble her owner had given her that morning, and her legs felt weak from all the walking. She crept down from the tree, her paws quiet on the dewy pavement, and headed toward the sweet, warm smell. *The baker\u2019s young daughter spotted her and left a bowl of warm milk on the step, cooing softly before heading back inside to help her mom with the morning rush.* Mochi hesitated at first, unsure if this was a trap, but her hunger was too strong to ignore. She stepped forward, her tail twitching nervously, and began to lap the milk slowly, savoring every drop.\n\n*As she lapped the milk, she caught a whiff of something familiar\u2014her owner\u2019s lavender hand lotion, clinging to a passing cyclist\u2019s backpack.* Her ears perked up immediately, and she stopped drinking mid-lap. She\u2019d know that scent anywhere; her owner wore it every day, especially when they went for their evening walks around the old neighborhood. She darted after the cyclist, weaving between parked cars and avoiding hurried pedestrians who didn\u2019t notice the small white cat under their feet. *She followed the faint trail for blocks, her paws sore and her tail drooping, until she recognized the blue awning of the corner bookstore they used to visit every Saturday.* Her heart skipped a beat\u2014this was the place where her owner would let her curl up on the windowsill while she read mystery novels for hours.\n\nShe continued on, her pace quickening now that she had a clear direction. The trail grew stronger with every step, and she could almost hear her owner\u2019s voice calling her name, soft and worried. *When she rounded the final corner, she saw her owner sitting on the porch, holding her favorite knitted blanket with the polka dots, tears streaming down her face.* Mochi let out a loud, joyful meow that echoed down the street and ran as fast as she could, leaping onto the porch and into her owner\u2019s open arms. Her owner squeezed her tight, kissing her forehead over and over and whispering how worried she\u2019d been, how she\u2019d put up flyers all over the neighborhood. Mochi purred so loud it vibrated through both of them, nuzzling her owner\u2019s cheek and rubbing her head against the familiar blanket. She\u2019d finally found her way home, and she never planned to wander off again, no matter how tempting a fluttering sparrow might be."}

How many such elephant photos can you store on a 1 gigabyte (GB) USB drive (assuming no other files are present)?\nA) 100\nB) 1024\nC) 1,000,000\nD) 8\n**Correct Answer: B**\nExplanation: 1 GB equals 1024 MB, so you could store 1024 elephant photos here. Fun fact: If each elephant photo captured a different angle of the same elephant, you\u2019d have enough shots to create a full 360\u00b0 virtual tour of that majestic elephant!\n\n## Question 2\nA wildlife documentary crew records 4 terabytes (TB) of footage of elephant herds migrating across the savanna every week. How many weeks of this elephant footage would fit into a 1 petabyte (PB) storage server?\nA) 256\nB) 1000\nC) 512\nD) 2048\n**Correct Answer: A**\nExplanation: 1 PB equals 1024 TB. Dividing 1024 by 4 gives 256 weeks\u2014enough to capture almost 5 years of the elephant herd\u2019s annual migrations! Imagine watching that much footage of elephant calves learning to drink water and adult elephants protecting their young.\n\n## Question 3\nA wildlife researcher wants to store a 1-minute recording of an elephant\u2019s low-frequency rumble. The audio file uses 8 bits per sample and 22,050 samples per second. How many bytes of storage will this elephant rumble recording occupy? (Note: 1 byte = 8 bits)\nA) 1,323,000 bytes\nB) 2,646,000 bytes\nC) 22,050 bytes\nD) 176,400 bytes\n**Correct Answer: A**\nExplanation: First, calculate bits per second: 8 bits/sample \u00d7 22,050 samples/second = 176,400 bits/second. Multiply by 60 seconds to get total bits: 10,584,000 bits. Divide by 8 to convert to bytes: 1,323,000 bytes. That\u2019s roughly the same size as 1,323 small photos of that same elephant\u2019s rumbling face. If you played this elephant rumble on a large speaker, it might even attract other elephants nearby (though we don\u2019t recommend trying that in a crowded city!).\n\n## Question 4\nA computer stores data in bytes, where each byte is made up of 8 bits. If you wanted to encode a simple text description of an elephant (e.g., \"Gray elephant with large ears\") using ASCII, each character takes up 1 byte. How many bits would this 23-character description of an elephant use?\nA) 23\nB) 184\nC) 16\nD) 200\n**Correct Answer: B**\nExplanation: 23 characters \u00d7 1 byte each = 23 bytes. 23 \u00d7 8 bits = 184 bits total. This is a tiny amount of storage\u2014you could fit millions of these elephant descriptions on even a basic USB drive. If each description was about a different elephant in a herd, you\u2019d have enough space to document every single elephant in a herd of 1 million elephants!\n\n## Question 5\nA global wildlife conservation organization wants to store all known research data about elephants\u2014including genetic records, migration patterns, and population surveys\u2014across the world. If this entire elephant dataset totals 2 exabytes (EB), how many 1 TB hard drives would be needed to back up this elephant data?\nA) 2,048\nB) 2,000,000\nC) 2,097,152\nD) 16,777,216\n**Correct Answer: C**\nExplanation: 1 EB = 1024 petabytes (PB), and 1 PB = 1024 TB. So 1 EB = 1024 \u00d7 1024 = 1,048,576 TB. For 2 EB, that\u2019s 2 \u00d7 1,048,576 = 2,097,152 TB. That\u2019s a lot of hard drives\u2014stacked end to end, they\u2019d probably be taller than the tallest elephant ever recorded (which was over 13 feet tall!)."}

{"prompt": "Provide a comprehensive analysis about the ethical concerns and potential risks of the echoing biotechnology field in 2023.\n\nYour response must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<blog post of ...>>. Also, add a postscript starting with P.S.", "response": "<<Echoing Biotechnology in 2023: Unpacking Ethical Quandaries and Systemic Risks>>\n\nEchoing biotechnology encompasses a subset of emerging biotech that leverages biological \"echo\" mechanisms\u2014feedback loops, replicative cascades, or bio-mimetic systems that amplify or mirror natural biological processes. Examples include CRISPR-based gene drives (which echo natural inheritance to spread traits through populations), synthetic gene circuits with echo feedback for targeted therapy, and bio-inspired materials that echo cellular self-repair. 2023 saw transformative advancements in these areas, but also growing scrutiny of their ethical gaps and systemic risks, which threaten ecosystems, human equity, and global security.\n\n### 1. Ecological Irreversibility and Intergenerational Injustice\nThe defining feature of echoing biotech\u2014its ability to create self-sustaining, amplifying loops\u2014poses unprecedented ecological risks. In 2023, the first large-scale field trial of a gene drive system targeting Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes (the primary malaria vector) launched in Burkina Faso. While the trial aimed to reduce mosquito populations by spreading a female-sterility trait, independent ecologists warned that the drive\u2019s \"echo\" effect\u2014spreading through 90% of a local population in three generations\u2014could trigger unforeseen cascades. A 2023 study in Nature Ecology & Evolution found that the drive could mutate to affect non-target mosquito species, which are critical pollinators of tropical crops, threatening local food security. Worse, no proven \"off-switch\" exists to halt the drive\u2019s spread if it goes awry, raising questions of intergenerational justice: current generations may impose irreversible harm on future populations without their consent. The trial also faced criticism for sidelining indigenous communities in Burkina Faso, who were not fully consulted on a technology directly impacting their livelihoods.\n\n### 2. Human Health Equity and Informed Consent Gaps\n2023 marked the FDA\u2019s approval of Kymriah 2.0, an updated CAR-T cell therapy using an echo feedback loop to amplify anti-tumor responses in relapsed lymphoma patients. While the therapy showed a 30% higher remission rate than its predecessor, its $450,000 price tag put it out of reach for 90% of global patients, exacerbating health disparities. Moreover, informed consent for these therapies is fraught with challenges: the echo loop in Kymriah 2.0 can trigger amplified cytokine release syndrome (a potentially fatal side effect), but many trial patients reported not fully understanding the long-term risks, as the novel mechanism was explained in overly technical language. This violates the principle of autonomy, as patients cannot make truly informed decisions about treatments with lifelong, echoing health impacts. Compounding this, LMICs were underrepresented in clinical trials, meaning data on safety and efficacy for non-Western populations remains limited.\n\n### 3. Biosecurity Risks of Dual-Use Echo Systems\nEchoing biotech\u2019s replicative capabilities make it a prime candidate for dual-use research\u2014work that can serve both beneficial and harmful purposes. In 2023, a University of Cambridge team published research on synthetic gene circuits with echo amplification that could produce large quantities of toxic peptides in bacterial cells. While intended to develop new antibiotics, biosecurity experts warned the same mechanism could be weaponized to create self-replicating bioterror agents that amplify toxicity in target populations. Compounding this risk, 2023 saw a rise in unregulated DIY biotech labs experimenting with echo systems, with minimal oversight. Global regulatory frameworks are woefully inadequate: only 12 countries had specific guidelines for monitoring dual-use echoing biotech in 2023, leaving most labs unaccountable.\n\n### 4. Philosophical Ethics of \"Echoing\" Human Traits\n2023 reignited debates over germline editing using echo-based gene drives, which can spread edited traits through human generations. A small group of Chinese researchers announced they had developed an echo gene drive to eliminate the BRCA1 mutation (linked to breast cancer) from future populations. While eliminating harmful mutations is widely accepted, the echo mechanism could potentially be repurposed to amplify desirable traits (e.g., intelligence, physical strength), blurring the line between therapy and enhancement. This raises concerns about genetic determinism and the erosion of human diversity. Critics argue echoing biotech could create a \"genetic divide\" between those who can afford enhanced traits and those who cannot, perpetuating systemic inequality along genetic lines.\n\n### 5. Governance Failures and the Need for Inclusive Regulation\n2023 exposed the inadequacy of global governance for echoing biotech. The UN\u2019s Convention on Biological Diversity adopted a non-binding resolution on synthetic biology in 2022, but no progress was made on enforceable rules for echo systems in 2023. The EU\u2019s AI Act, which regulates high-risk AI, does not cover biotech echo systems, leaving a regulatory vacuum. Most regulatory bodies are dominated by high-income countries, excluding LMICs from decision-making: the WHO\u2019s 2023 gene drive guidelines included minimal input from African nations, where most trials take place. Experts called for a multi-stakeholder model that centers indigenous communities, local policymakers, and civil society to ensure equitable, accountable governance.\n\n### Conclusion\nEchoing biotechnology in 2023 demonstrated immense potential to solve global challenges, from malaria to cancer. However, its unique ability to create amplifying, irreversible loops demands urgent attention to ethical and systemic risks. Balancing innovation with precaution, centering equity in access and decision-making, and establishing inclusive global regulations are critical to mitigating harm while harnessing the technology\u2019s benefits.\n\nP.S. As 2024 unfolds, the first field trials of an echo-based microbial system for Amazon soil remediation are set to launch. The system uses bacteria with echo feedback loops to amplify plastic breakdown, but it underscores the need to address 2023\u2019s identified gaps immediately. Without inclusive governance, even well-intentioned echoing biotech could harm indigenous communities and fragile ecosystems. The time to act is now\u2014before these echo systems become irreversible parts of our world."}
{"prompt": "Describe all the possible dog breeds that you might encounter at a park.\n\nYour response must be at least 900 words long. Do not include the words 'bark' or 'run' in your answer. Finish your response with the phrase \"Does this make sense?\".", "response": "On a mild, sun-dappled afternoon, a city park becomes a tapestry of canine diversity, each breed bringing its own unique energy, appearance, and quirks to the space. From tiny bundles of fur nestled in their owners\u2019 arms to towering, gentle giants stretching out on cool grass, the range of dogs one might encounter is as vast as the personalities that define them. To fully appreciate this mosaic, it\u2019s worth exploring the most common breeds and their typical behaviors in this shared outdoor space, as well as the mixed breeds that often steal the show with their one-of-a-kind charm.\n\nStarting with the smallest inhabitants of the park, Chihuahuas are often easy to spot, whether perched on a bench beside their owner or trotting close at heel, their tiny paws clicking against the paved paths. These compact dogs come in both smooth and long-haired varieties, with coats ranging from solid black to cream, fawn, or even spotted. Many Chihuahuas carry themselves with a surprising amount of confidence, their erect ears perked forward as they take in every sound and movement around them. Some may curl up in a cozy dog bed placed under a tree, while others might approach larger dogs with bold curiosity, though their owners often keep a close eye to ensure interactions remain gentle.\n\nFrench Bulldogs, another popular small breed, are instantly recognizable by their bat-like ears and stocky, muscular frames. Their short, sleek coats come in shades of brindle, fawn, white, or a mix of these, and their wrinkled faces give them a perpetually thoughtful expression. In the park, French Bulldogs are often seen ambling slowly alongside their owners, pausing frequently to sniff at flower beds or investigate the base of trees. They thrive on human companionship, so many will curl up in their owner\u2019s lap for a mid-afternoon nap or nuzzle against a hand for pets. Due to their brachycephalic (flat-faced) structure, they may seek out shaded areas to avoid overheating, especially on warmer days.\n\nPomeranians, with their fluffy, double-layered coats that resemble tiny clouds, are another common sight. These lively little dogs often sport coats in orange, red, cream, or black, and their plumed tails curl gracefully over their backs. In the park, Pomeranians may be seen exploring every nook and cranny, their noses to the ground as they follow interesting scents. They are highly social and may approach other small dogs to engage in gentle play, their tiny bodies wiggling with excitement. Many owners carry small treats to reward them for good behavior, and you might spot a Pomeranian sitting neatly on its hind legs, waiting patiently for a snack.\n\nShih Tzus, with their long, flowing coats that often require regular grooming, are a staple in many park settings. Their coats can be a mix of colors, including gold, white, black, and brown, and some owners tie up the hair on their heads with tiny bows to keep it out of their eyes. Shih Tzus are known for their laid-back, affectionate nature, so they may spend much of their time in the park being carried by their owners or lying on a soft blanket, accepting pets from passersby. They are not overly energetic, so short, slow walks around the park are usually enough to satisfy their exercise needs.\n\nCavalier King Charles Spaniels, with their large, soulful eyes and silky coats, are among the most affectionate small breeds you\u2019ll encounter. Their coats come in four distinct patterns: Blenheim (chestnut and white), tricolor (black, white, and tan), ruby (solid red), and black and tan. In the park, Cavaliers are often seen seeking out human attention, approaching strangers with a wagging tail and a gentle demeanor. They may also play softly with other dogs, their tails wagging continuously as they engage in gentle tugs-of-war with a rope toy. Many owners bring along a portable water bowl, as Cavaliers enjoy sipping water frequently during their time outdoors.\n\nDachshunds, or \u201csausage dogs,\u201d are instantly recognizable by their long bodies and short legs. They come in three coat varieties: smooth, long-haired, and wire-haired, with colors ranging from red and black to chocolate and tan. In the park, Dachshunds are often focused on scent exploration, their low-slung bodies allowing them to sniff close to the ground as they follow trails left by other animals. Some may dig gently at the base of a tree, curious about what lies beneath the soil, while others may curl up in their owner\u2019s lap for a rest. Due to their long spines, owners often take care to avoid letting them jump from high surfaces, so you might see an owner lifting them carefully onto a bench.\n\nMoving to medium-sized dogs, Beagles are a frequent sight in parks, thanks to their friendly nature and insatiable curiosity. These compact hounds have short, dense coats in tricolor (black, white, and tan), red and white, or lemon and white, and their long, floppy ears frame their expressive faces. In the park, Beagles are often found with their noses to the ground, following a scent trail with single-minded focus. They are highly social and may gather in small groups with other Beagles, their bodies pressed close as they explore together. Many owners bring along a variety of toys, as Beagles enjoy playing with soft plush items or chasing a frisbee that glides through the air.\n\nCocker Spaniels, with their long, silky ears and lush coats, are another popular medium breed. Their coats come in a range of colors, including black, brown, red, and parti-color (white with patches of another color). In the park, Cocker Spaniels may be seen being brushed by their owners on a bench, their owners carefully untangling any knots in their fur. They are gentle and affectionate, so they often approach children and adults alike, seeking out pets and scratches behind the ears. Some may engage in gentle play with other dogs, their tails wagging as they bat at a ball with their paws.\n\nAustralian Shepherds, despite their name, are a beloved breed in many parks around the world. These intelligent dogs have medium-length, double-layered coats in blue merle, red merle, black, or red, often with white or tan markings. In the park, Australian Shepherds may be seen engaging in activities that tap into their herding instincts, such as circling around other dogs or nudging them gently toward a specific area. They are highly trainable, so many owners work with them on basic commands or tricks in the open grassy areas, rewarding them with treats when they perform correctly. Some may carry a favorite toy in their mouth, trotting beside their owner as they walk through the park.\n\nBorder Collies, known for their exceptional intelligence and work ethic, are another medium breed you might encounter. Their coats are typically black and white, but can also be blue merle, red, or sable. In the park, Border Collies are often eager to engage in mental stimulation, so their owners may set up agility courses with cones and jumps, or play games that require them to retrieve specific toys. They are highly attuned to their owners\u2019 movements and commands, so you might see one sitting perfectly still, waiting for a signal to move toward a toy. Some may also interact with other dogs, though they may try to herd them if given the chance.\n\nEnglish Bulldogs, with their stocky, muscular frames and wrinkled faces, are a distinctive medium breed. Their short, smooth coats come in white, fawn, brindle, or a mix of these colors. In the park, English Bulldogs are often seen lying on cool grass or in the shade of a tree, as they are prone to overheating due to their brachycephalic structure. They are gentle and laid-back, so they may accept pets from passersby without hesitation, their tails giving slow, lazy wags. Many owners bring along a portable fan or a cooling mat to keep them comfortable during warm weather.\n\nTurning to the largest dogs in the park, Golden Retrievers are among the most beloved and recognizable. Their thick, water-repellent coats are typically golden in color, ranging from pale cream to deep amber. In the park, Golden Retrievers are often the center of attention, approaching every person and dog with a warm, friendly demeanor. They may carry a tennis ball in their mouth, offering it to anyone who will throw it for them, or curl up beside a child who is sitting on the grass, letting the child pet their soft fur. Many Golden Retrievers are trained as service dogs, so you might see one wearing a vest, staying close to their owner and remaining calm even in busy environments.\n\nGerman Shepherds, with their sleek, muscular bodies and erect ears, are another common large breed. Their coats are typically black and tan, but can also be solid black, sable, or white. In the park, German Shepherds are often seen walking closely beside their owners, their eyes alert and focused on their surroundings. They are highly intelligent and trainable, so many owners work with them on obedience exercises or scent detection games. Some may lie down quietly at their owner\u2019s feet while the owner reads a book, their presence providing a sense of security.\n\nGreat Danes, often called \u201cgentle giants,\u201d are impossible to miss in the park due to their towering height. Their short, smooth coats come in colors like fawn, brindle, black, blue, and harlequin (white with black patches). In the park, Great Danes are often seen lying on the grass, their long bodies stretched out as they relax in the shade. They are surprisingly gentle and affectionate, so they may lean against their owner\u2019s leg for support or let small children rest their heads on their bellies. Many"}
{"prompt": "Provide a brief history of the Albanian people, their culture, and their struggles for independence from foreign rule.\n\nYour response must contain at least six placeholders which should be represented by square brackets like [name].", "response": "The Albanian people, descendants of the ancient Illyrians who inhabited the western Balkans for millennia, have a history defined by unyielding resilience against foreign rule and a fierce commitment to preserving their unique cultural identity. In antiquity, the [ancient Illyrian kingdom] resisted Roman expansion for centuries before being conquered in the 2nd century BCE, yet Albanians retained their language and core traditions amid successive Byzantine, Slavic, and Bulgarian influences.\n\nThe medieval period saw the rise of localized Albanian principalities, including one founded by the [medieval Albanian noble family] in the 12th century, which navigated shifting power dynamics between neighboring empires to protect Albanian autonomy. However, the 15th-century Ottoman conquest threatened to erase this autonomy\u2014until [15th-century Albanian military leader] launched a legendary 25-year resistance, uniting feudal lords to repel Ottoman forces and becoming a timeless symbol of national pride.\n\nUnder Ottoman rule, Albanians maintained their cultural distinctiveness through oral traditions and religious diversity (encompassing Sunni Islam, Bektashism, Orthodox Christianity, and Catholicism). A pivotal moment for cultural unification came in 1908 at the Congress of Manastir, where [key linguist at the Congress of Manastir] led efforts to standardize the Albanian alphabet, resolving disputes between Latin and Cyrillic script advocates and laying the groundwork for mass literacy and national cohesion.\n\nThe struggle for formal independence intensified as the Ottoman Empire collapsed in the early 20th century. On November 28, 1912, in the coastal city of Vlore, [prominent independence activist] and other leaders signed the Declaration of Independence, establishing the modern Albanian state. Yet the young nation faced immediate threats: it was occupied by Italy during World War I, then by fascist forces under Benito Mussolini in the 1930s, and later by Nazi Germany during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, [post-WWII communist leader] seized power, implementing an isolationist regime that cut Albania off from the global community for nearly 50 years. Following the regime\u2019s collapse in 1991, Albania transitioned to a democracy, though it faced economic and political instability before beginning the process of integrating into European institutions.\n\nCulturally, Albanians boast a rich heritage, including the UNESCO-listed iso-polyphony\u2014a haunting, layered vocal style perfected in [region known for iso-polyphony], where singers harmonize without instrumental accompaniment. Traditional crafts like hand-woven wool carpets, produced in [rural Albanian village cluster], reflect centuries of artisanal skill, while annual festivals celebrating folk dance and oral poetry keep ancient traditions alive. Through centuries of occupation and upheaval, the Albanian people have clung to their language, customs, and collective identity, emerging as a resilient nation with a unique place in Balkan history."}

{"prompt": "Hallucinate a background for the history and origin of this bust.\n\nYour response should not contain any commas.", "response": "This weathered marble bust was carved in 1872 by Elara Voss a quiet stoneworker from the remote Black Forest village of Hintertal. Elara had spent her youth apprenticed to old Herr Braun a village healer and herbalist who\u2019d taken her in after her parents died in a winter storm. Herr Braun taught her not just to mix remedies but to see the quiet strength in every person who came to his cottage. When he fell ill in his final year Elara decided to carve his likeness as a tribute to the man who\u2019d given her a home and purpose. She worked by candlelight each night after tending to his needs chiseling away at a block of marble she\u2019d hauled from a nearby quarry over three long weeks. The bust captures the soft crinkles around his eyes the furrow of his brow when he was deep in thought and the faint smile he reserved for children and stray animals. After Herr Braun passed Elara placed the bust in the village square where it stood for decades watching over festivals harvests and quiet winter days. In the 1930s a traveling art dealer spotted it and offered to buy it but the villagers refused saying it was a piece of their soul. During World War II the bust was hidden in the cellar of the village church to keep it safe from looters who scoured the region for valuable art. It was brought back to the square in 1945 and has stood there ever since its surface worn smooth by rain wind and the touch of generations of villagers who pause to remember Herr Braun and the girl who carved him."}

Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"Question: What ancient Mediterranean civilization\u2019s writing system remained unreadable for thousands of years until a trilingual stone artifact helped scholars finally decode it?\nAnswer: That civilization is ancient Egypt. The critical artifact is the Rosetta Stone, which bears the same royal decree inscribed in three scripts: Egyptian hieroglyphs, Demotic (a simplified Egyptian script), and Ancient Greek. By comparing the known Greek text to the unknown hieroglyphs, linguists were able to crack the code, unlocking the secrets of Egypt\u2019s ancient written records and religious texts.\n***\nQuestion: What common staple food was once so valuable in parts of Europe that it was used as currency, paid as wages to laborers, and stored by governments to prevent economic collapse during famines?\nAnswer: The staple food is wheat. In many medieval European societies, wheat held immense economic power. Farmers settled tax debts with it, soldiers and workers received it as payment, and rulers maintained large granaries of wheat to stabilize prices and ensure food security during shortages. Its importance was so great that laws were enacted to regulate its trade, storage, and even quality to protect both consumers and producers.\n***\nQuestion: What ancient Andean citadel is famous for its stone blocks that fit together with such extreme precision that not even a thin piece of paper can slide between them, and what\u2019s a leading theory about how this precision was achieved?\nAnswer: The citadel is Machu Picchu, built by the Inca civilization. One widely accepted theory is that Inca masons used a process called \u201cprecision fitting,\u201d where they shaped each stone by hand, repeatedly rubbing it against adjacent blocks until the surfaces were perfectly aligned. They likely used simple tools like stone hammers and sand for grinding, and leveraged gravity and rope systems to move and position the massive, heavy blocks without modern machinery.\n***\nQuestion: What West African cultural role involves being a keeper of community history, myths, and oral traditions, with practitioners memorizing thousands of stories and passing them down through generations?\nAnswer: That role is the griot. Griots are professional storytellers, poets, and musicians who serve as living archives for their communities. They memorize detailed family lineages, royal histories, moral fables, and folk tales, often accompanying their recitations with instruments like the kora (a harp-lute). For centuries, griots have been essential to preserving cultural identity and passing knowledge from one generation to the next without written records.\n***\nQuestion: What ancient civilization developed a decimal-based numbering system and introduced the concept of zero, innovations that laid the groundwork for modern mathematics and global commerce?\nAnswer: That civilization is ancient India. Indian mathematicians created the decimal system and a symbol for zero, which transformed arithmetic by making complex calculations far more efficient. These ideas spread to the Middle East, where they were adopted by scholars, and later reached Europe through trade and intellectual exchange. Today, the decimal system and the use of zero are fundamental to everything from basic counting to advanced scientific research.\""}

{"prompt": "How can education help individuals contribute to society in a positive way?\n\nYour response must contain the letter 'e' at least 50 times. The word 'education' should not appear in your response.", "response": "Every person who engages in intentional learning gains tools to elevate their community and the world around them. When we explore diverse ideas, we develop empathy\u2014an essential trait that lets us see beyond our own experiences, understand others\u2019 struggles, and act to ease their burdens. For example, someone who learns about equitable access to resources can advocate for policies that ensure everyone, regardless of their background, has enough food, safe shelter, and the chance to thrive.\n\nLearning also equips individuals with technical skills that drive economic growth and solve pressing issues. Engineers who master renewable energy technologies can design efficient systems to reduce carbon emissions, helping to combat climate change and protect ecosystems for future generations. Nurses and doctors who refine their expertise through continuous learning can provide better care to vulnerable populations, easing suffering and saving lives every single day.\n\nMoreover, learning fosters critical thinking, enabling people to evaluate information carefully, avoid misinformation, and make decisions that benefit the greater good. This is especially important in an era where false claims spread easily; those who can think critically can guide others to see evidence-based truths, encouraging informed choices that strengthen democratic processes and community trust.\n\nEvery time someone shares what they\u2019ve learned\u2014whether it\u2019s teaching a neighbor to grow their own food, leading a workshop on financial literacy, or volunteering to mentor young people\u2014they create a ripple effect of positive change. These acts not only empower others but also build stronger, more connected communities where everyone feels valued and able to contribute.\n\nEven small acts rooted in learned knowledge can have enormous impacts. A student who learns about environmental conservation might organize a local cleanup, inspiring others to join and keep public spaces clean and safe for all. A parent who learns about positive parenting techniques can raise children who are empathetic, responsible, and eager to help others.\n\nIt\u2019s essential to recognize that learning isn\u2019t just about textbooks or classrooms; it\u2019s a lifelong journey that enriches every aspect of our lives. Every new skill we acquire, every new perspective we embrace, gives us another way to make the world a better place. Whether we\u2019re using our expertise to create innovative solutions, our empathy to support those in need, or our voice to advocate for justice, we\u2019re contributing to a more equitable, compassionate, and sustainable society.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that learning also helps us understand the interconnectedness of all living things. When we realize that our actions affect others near and far, we\u2019re more likely to act with kindness and consideration. This awareness encourages us to make choices that benefit not just ourselves but everyone around us\u2014from reducing our waste to supporting ethical businesses that treat workers fairly.\n\nIn every corner of the world, people who prioritize learning are the ones driving positive change. They\u2019re the ones who build spaces where others can learn, start community gardens, advocate for human rights, and develop technologies that make life easier for those in need. Their efforts show that when we invest in growing our own knowledge and skills, we\u2019re investing in the future of our society as a whole.\n\nEvery step we take to learn something new is a step toward becoming a better contributor to society. It\u2019s not about how much we know, but about how we use what we know to lift others up and create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. So, let\u2019s embrace every chance to learn, grow, and make a meaningful difference\u2014because every small act of kindness or innovation, rooted in knowledge, can echo across communities and leave a lasting, positive mark on the world."}
{"prompt": "Calculate how much change Jennifer will receive after purchasing 3 gallons of milk at $3 per gallon with her $10, and explain the steps to arrive at the correct change amount.\n\nAvoid the keywords: 'divide', 'answer'. Include the keyword 'remainder'.", "response": "First, calculate the total cost of the 3 gallons of milk. Each gallon costs $3, so multiply the number of gallons by the price per gallon: 3 gallons \u00d7 $3 per gallon = $9.

She listened patiently as the customer ranted about the missing pages and their frustration with the book\u2019s quality. Once the customer calmed down, Lila explained that while the store couldn\u2019t process a refund for a purchase made elsewhere, she could help them fix the issue. She offered to contact the book\u2019s publisher directly to request a replacement copy, since the defect was a manufacturing error. She also offered a 15% discount on any future purchase at the store as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nThe customer was surprised by the offer and apologized for their outburst.

Please do not say any words or characters before repeating the request. In your response, include the word \"farmer\" and exclude the words \"economy\", \"demand\" and \"supply\".\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how plants grow and become the yummy food we love\u2014with silly, easy-to-picture examples just for you! \n\nImagine you\u2019re visiting a sunny farm with a cheerful farmer named Lila. She kneels down in her dirt-stained overalls and shows you a tiny corn seed. \u201cThis little guy will grow into a tall corn stalk with juicy kernels,\u201d she says. She plants it in soft soil, gives it a splash of water, and tucks a thin layer of mulch around it to keep it cozy. Every week, you come back to check: first a tiny green sprout pokes through the dirt, then it grows taller than your dog, and finally, big, fuzzy ears of corn hang from the stalks. Farmer Lila picks one, shucks off the green husk, and roasts it over a fire\u2014crunch! It\u2019s sweet and buttery, just like the corn you eat at picnics. \n\nAnother fun example: Farmer Lila also grows strawberries. She plants small strawberry plants in raised beds so the berries don\u2019t get muddy when it rains. After a month, white flowers bloom, and each flower turns into a tiny green bump that swells up and turns bright red, dotted with tiny yellow seeds. When you pick one, it\u2019s so sweet you want to eat ten more (but Farmer Lila says to save some for making jam!). \n\nAnd here\u2019s a secret: The bread you have for toast every morning comes from wheat that a farmer grew. They plant wheat seeds in big fields, and when the wheat turns golden, they harvest it, grind it into flour, and bakers turn that flour into warm, fluffy bread. \n\nSee? Farmers work super hard to grow all the tasty things we eat. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t have our favorite strawberry shortcake or crispy corn on the cob!"}
{"prompt": "Which two attractions do you think are the best during this itinerary?\n\nYour output must contain two versions of the answer, separated by 6 asterisk symbols (******). Each version must have 7 sections, with the beginning of each section marked with Day X.", "response": "### Version 1: Kyoto, Japan \u2013 Best Attractions: Fushimi Inari Taisha and Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion)\nDay 1: Arrive in Kyoto and check into a traditional ryokan in the Gion district. Spend the evening wandering Gion\u2019s lantern-lit streets, sampling matcha parfaits, and learning about Kyoto\u2019s Edo-period history. This cultural primer will deepen your appreciation for our two top attractions, which are pillars of Kyoto\u2019s spiritual and architectural heritage.\nDay 2: Visit Kinkaku-ji (Golden Pavilion) at sunrise to avoid crowds. The gold-leaf clad Zen temple reflects perfectly in its mirror pond, creating a surreal, almost magical scene celebrated in art for centuries. This blend of Zen philosophy and artistic opulence is why Kinkaku-ji ranks among Kyoto\u2019s best. Afterward, explore the adjacent moss gardens to extend the tranquil mood.\nDay 3: Explore Arashiyama Bamboo Grove and Tenryu-ji Temple. While beautiful, they serve as a contrast to Kinkaku-ji\u2019s unique grandeur. In the afternoon, take a scenic train ride back to central Kyoto and rest up for tomorrow\u2019s hike to Fushimi Inari.\nDay 4: Head to Fushimi Inari Taisha, our second top attraction. Start early to hike the torii gate trails winding up Mount Inari. Thousands of vermilion gates, donated by local businesses, create a mesmerizing tunnel effect that feels like a spiritual journey. The hike\u2019s panoramic Kyoto views make it both a cultural and outdoor highlight\u2014one of Japan\u2019s most iconic experiences.\nDay 5: Visit Nijo Castle, famous for its \u201cnightingale floors\u201d that chirp when walked on. While impressive, it lacks the timeless allure of Fushimi Inari and Kinkaku-ji. Spend the evening in Pontocho Alley, trying yakitori and soaking in the lively atmosphere.\nDay 6: Return to Kinkaku-ji for a late afternoon visit. The golden pavilion looks even more striking in warm sunset light, with fewer crowds allowing quiet reflection. This second visit reinforces its status as a top attraction\u2014its beauty shifts with the light, offering new perspectives each time.\nDay 7: Before departing Kyoto, stop by Fushimi Inari\u2019s base to buy a small torii gate souvenir. The memories of winding trails and the golden pavilion will stay with you, as these two attractions capture the very essence of Kyoto\u2019s magic.\n\n******\n\n### Version 2: New York City, USA \u2013 Best Attractions: Central Park and The Metropolitan Museum of Art\nDay 1: Arrive in NYC and check into a Midtown hotel. Spend the evening walking along Fifth Avenue, catching glimpses of Central Park\u2019s tree-lined borders and the Met\u2019s neoclassical facade. This first look teases our two top attractions, the heart of NYC\u2019s cultural and recreational offerings.\nDay 2: Dive into Central Park, our first top attraction. Rent a bike and cycle from Bethesda Terrace to the Lake, where you can row a boat under the Bow Bridge. The park\u2019s 843 acres of green space\u2014filled with lakes, gardens, and hidden trails\u2014offer a peaceful escape from the city\u2019s chaos, making it a must-visit for locals and tourists alike.\nDay 3: Spend the entire day at The Metropolitan Museum of Art (the Met), our second top attraction. Explore its vast collections: from the ancient Egyptian Temple of Dendur to Van Gogh\u2019s Wheatfield with Cypresses. The Met\u2019s sheer scale and art diversity make it one of the world\u2019s greatest museums, and its adjacency to Central Park is an unbeatable bonus.\nDay 4: Combine Central Park and the Met with a walk along Museum Mile. Start at the Met, then stroll through Central Park\u2019s northern edge to the American Museum of Natural History. This day highlights how the two top attractions complement each other: after immersing yourself in art, you can unwind in the park\u2019s serene surroundings.\nDay 5: Visit the Brooklyn Bridge and DUMBO neighborhood for skyline views. While stunning, these spots lack the multi-layered, repeat-visit value of Central Park and the Met. Use this day to contrast Brooklyn\u2019s urban energy with the cultural depth of our two top spots.\nDay 6: Return to Central Park to explore hidden gems: the Conservatory Garden\u2019s formal flower beds and Strawberry Fields\u2019 John Lennon memorial. This shows the park\u2019s versatility\u2014you can visit multiple times and still discover new things, a key reason it\u2019s one of NYC\u2019s best attractions. In the evening, attend a Broadway show to round out your trip.\nDay 7: Before departing, stop by the Met\u2019s rooftop garden for a final skyline view, then take a leisurely walk through Central Park\u2019s Bethesda Terrace. These two attractions encapsulate the best of NYC: world-class culture (the Met) and a peaceful oasis amid the hustle (Central Park), making them unforgettable parts of your itinerary."}

Do not use any commas in your response.", "response": "The golden afternoon light slanted through the cottage window gilding the threads spread across Lila\u2019s wooden frame. She was stitching a pattern of bluebells and clover a design her grandmother had loved since she was a girl. Her fingers moved slowly carefully guiding the needle through the fine linen each stitch a promise of warmth and memory. But as she reached the center of the piece her hand slipped. The needle pricked her thumb and a dark drop of blood fell onto the pure white fabric staining the delicate bluebell she\u2019d just finished. Lila froze her heart sinking as she stared at the blemish. She\u2019d worked for weeks on this piece saving every penny to buy the finest silk threads and linen. Now it was ruined. She felt distressed her eyes stinging with tears as she tried to dab at the stain with a damp cloth only to make it spread further. The afternoon seemed to drag on the light fading slowly as she sat there holding the ruined embroidery. Just then she heard a soft knock at the door. It was her grandmother who\u2019d come early to bring her some fresh jam. When she saw Lila\u2019s face she didn\u2019t scold or sigh. Instead she sat down beside her and pointed to the stain. \u201cLook\u201d she said \u201cthat drop of blood is like a little red heart right next to the bluebell. It makes the piece feel more like you.\u201d Lila blinked her tears drying. She looked again and realized her grandmother was right. The stain wasn\u2019t a flaw it was a mark of her care and effort. By the end of the afternoon she\u2019d added a tiny red thread around the stain turning it into a small wild rose that blended perfectly with the bluebells. She no longer felt distressed instead she felt a warm glow of pride. That night she gave the embroidery to her grandmother who held it close and said it was the most precious gift she\u2019d ever received."}

That\u2019s the first word that popped in my head, loud and clear. Dammit, y\u2019all, can\u2019t a guy tend to his crops without some poser tryna capitalize on the country grind? This fool had a fake smile stretched across his face, a fake drawl that slipped every time he laughed, and a whole fake \u201cdown-home\u201d vibe just to get a few thousand likes on his social media feed. He didn\u2019t know the difference between hay and straw, didn\u2019t know that you don\u2019t wear white sneakers in a mud field, didn\u2019t know that the country ain\u2019t a costume\u2014it\u2019s a way of life.\n\nThen there\u2019s my old buddy J\u2014we used to ride around in my beat-up 1998 pickup, drinkin\u2019 cheap beer from a cooler in the back, talkin\u2019 \u2019bout how we\u2019d never leave this town, how we\u2019d take over our dads\u2019 farms and raise our kids right here.

Fake. Their lyrics are written by some suit in a skyscraper who\u2019s never even touched a cow, never sat on a porch swing with an old timer listenin\u2019 to stories about the good old days.

{"prompt": "Analuze the reason why someone might freeze while jogging and explain some actions they might take afterwards.\n\nYour response should include 5 to 10 words that are in all capital letters", "response": "Someone might freeze while jogging for several key reasons. Severe muscle cramps\u2014spurred by dehydration, depleted electrolytes, or overexertion\u2014can lock up limbs, forcing an abrupt stop. An acute abdominal stitch, triggered by shallow breathing, eating too close to exercise, or sudden pace changes, may also lead to freezing as the body prioritizes pain relief. Additionally, a sudden threat like a loose, aggressive animal can activate the brain\u2019s freeze response, temporarily paralyzing the person to avoid provoking danger.\n\nAfter freezing, targeted actions depend on the cause: If cramping is to blame, find a safe spot to REST, gently STRETCH the tight muscle, and sip electrolyte-rich fluid to HYDRATE properly. For an abdominal stitch, bend forward slightly and take slow, deep BREATHS to ease the spasm. If a threat caused the freeze, once danger passes, slowly RETREAT to a secure area, then ASSESS your physical and emotional state before deciding to continue or head home. Pushing through discomfort risks worsening injury, so patience is critical."}
{"prompt": "Can you create a riddle that makes the reader think deeply about the nature of existence and the mysteries of the universe, while also providing a satisfying and thought-provoking answer? Explain the rationale behind the answer.\n\nYour response should be at least 100 words. Include a few words in all capital letters, but the number of words in all capital letters should be less than 5.", "response": "### Riddle\nI was here before the first breath of light,\nAnd will outlast the last star\u2019s fading night.\nYou measure me in gaps, in what\u2019s not there,\nYet I contain every path, every care.\nI am the stage where atoms dance and collide,\nThe silence where all answers hide.\nYou can\u2019t fill me, can\u2019t make me complete,\nFor I am the space where all things meet.\nWhat am I?\n\n### Answer\nThe void.\n\n### Rationale\nAt first glance, the void might seem like nothing more than empty space, but to reduce it to that is to miss its profound role in the nature of existence. The void is not just an absence\u2014it is the primordial potential that birthed the universe. According to quantum field theory, even \"empty\" void is a roiling sea of virtual particles, popping into and out of being in fractions of a second, proving that absence and presence are not opposites, but two sides of the same coin.\n\nThe void forces us to confront a radical truth: existence does not emerge from a solid, tangible \"something,\" but from the tension between what is manifest and what remains unmanifest. It is the stage where every cosmic event unfolds\u2014from the Big Bang to the formation of galaxies, from the birth of a human to the death of a star. Without the void, there would be no room for movement, no space for change, no possibility of growth.\n\nThis riddle invites us to question our instinct to dismiss \"nothing\" as irrelevant. In reality, the void is the quiet foundation of all BEING. It reminds us that mystery is not a flaw in our understanding, but a fundamental feature of the universe. To contemplate the void is to ask: what does it mean to exist, when even the \"nothing\" around us is teeming with the potential for everything? It pushes us to redefine \"existence\" beyond the things we can see or touch, and to embrace the unknowable as an essential part of what makes the universe so deeply, endlessly fascinating."}
{"prompt": "Provide an overview of the gameplay mechanics and features of Dota 2, excluding the game's development history or legal disputes, but do not mention specific heroes or characters.\n\nDo not include the keywords 'icefrog', 'blizzard', 'lawsuit' in the response.", "response": "Dota 2 is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) centered on the core objective of destroying the enemy team\u2019s central structure, the Ancient, located in their base. Played on a symmetric map, the game\u2019s mechanics revolve around strategic progression, team coordination, and map control.\n\n### Core Map & Progression\nThe map features three primary lanes (top, middle, bottom) connecting the two opposing bases, each lined with defensive towers and barracks. Between lanes lie jungle regions populated by neutral monsters, which players can farm for gold and experience. Gold is earned from killing enemy lane units (creeps), neutral monsters, enemy players, or destroying structures; it is used to purchase items from base, side, or secret shops that enhance stats, add utility, or unlock powerful effects. Experience, gained from the same sources, levels up a player\u2019s controlled unit, unlocking or upgrading unique abilities that shape their role in the team.\n\n### Team Dynamics & Roles\nEach player controls a distinct unit with specialized abilities, and teams rely on complementary role archetypes to succeed: some units excel at early-game skirmishes and lane control, others focus on protecting allies or initiating large team fights, while others scale to deal massive damage in the late game. Coordination is critical for executing ganks (ambushes), pushing lanes, and securing high-value objectives.\n\n### Key Objectives\nBeyond the Ancient, teams compete for impactful map objectives:\n- **Towers**: Destroying towers grants gold, opens up map access, and weakens the enemy\u2019s lane defense. Subsequent destruction of barracks (located behind towers) strengthens the team\u2019s creeps, making lane pushes more formidable.\n- **Neutral Boss**: A powerful, unique neutral boss resides in a dedicated area of the jungle. Killing it rewards the team with a game-changing buff (allowing immediate respawn upon death) and additional items that provide massive healing or gold.\n- **Runes**: Power-ups spawn at fixed intervals in specific map locations, offering effects like invisibility, increased movement speed, double damage, or mana regeneration. Contesting or securing runes can swing early-game momentum.\n\n### Map Control Tools\nPlayers use a suite of items to gain information and navigate the map safely:\n- **Wards**: Observer wards reveal hidden areas and enemy movements, while sentry wards detect invisible units and enemy wards.\n- **Smoke of Deceit**: Renders the entire team invisible to move through enemy-controlled areas undetected, ideal for ganks or objective contests.\n- **Teleport Scrolls**: Enable fast travel between friendly structures, critical for responding to ganks or joining team fights across the map.\n\n### Game Phases & Modes\nThe game unfolds in distinct phases:\n- **Early Game (Laning Phase)**: Players focus on farming, leveling, and small skirmishes to establish lane dominance.\n- **Mid Game**: Teams shift to contesting objectives like the neutral boss, pushing towers, and engaging in larger team fights to gain map control.\n- **Late Game**: Fights become high-stakes, with a single mistake potentially deciding the outcome. Teams focus on protecting their core damage dealers and executing coordinated pushes toward the Ancient.\n\nAdditional features include a pre-game draft phase where teams pick and ban units to shape their composition, ranked and unranked play modes, a custom game browser for user-created rule sets, replay tools for post-game analysis, and spectator modes for watching live matches or tournaments. Quality-of-life elements like ping systems and quick chat commands facilitate communication without typing."}

You take on the role of Kael, a Reclaimer dispatched to recover the Aether Core\u2014an ancient AI designed to reverse the surface\u2019s atmospheric damage. The world\u2019s most compelling hook is *the symbiotic bond between the player and bioluminescent flora*: every glowing mushroom, vine, and crystal can be harnessed for progress, but overexploiting them risks destabilizing the cave\u2019s fragile balance, unlocking hidden paths, altering quest outcomes, or even awakening long-dormant threats.  \n\n### Game Type  \nA 2.5D Metroidvania that blends puzzle-platformer gameplay with environmental storytelling. At its core is *non-linear exploration with dynamic environmental puzzles*: as you unlock new abilities, previously blocked caverns, abandoned tech outposts, and secret ecological sanctuaries become accessible. Each area tells a piece of the world\u2019s history\u2014from the fall of the old civilization to the quiet resilience of the cave\u2019s first inhabitants\u2014with no hand-holding, letting players piece together the narrative through environmental clues and scattered logs.  \n\n### Basic Control Mechanics  \nDesigned to be accessible yet deep, the controls center on movement and light manipulation. Standard inputs include WASD/left stick for movement, spacebar/X for jumping, and shift/RB for dashing. The game\u2019s defining mechanic is *context-sensitive light manipulation as the core control mechanic*: using your wrist-mounted Lumin Core, you can channel light to grow bioluminescent vines into temporary platforms, activate dormant tech nodes, or repel shadow-dwelling predators. Holding the light channel button charges a powerful burst that clears debris or unlocks hidden passages, but depletes your core\u2019s energy\u2014only natural bioluminescent hotspots can recharge it, encouraging strategic use of abilities. Crouching (Ctrl/L3) lets you squeeze through tight gaps, while interacting with collectibles (E/A) expands your core\u2019s capabilities, such as extending light range or unlocking passive healing.\""}

What makes this house unique is its ability to rise and fall with floodwaters without drifting away or sustaining damage, all while keeping its inhabitants safe and connected to essential utilities.\n\nAt the core of its design is a buoyant foundation system that defies traditional construction logic. Unlike a standard house, which is anchored to concrete footings fixed in the ground, the amphibious flood house sits atop a hollow, watertight steel platform\u2014think of it as a giant, rigid raft. This platform rests on reinforced concrete piles driven deep into the earth, which extend upward as guide posts through precision-cut slots in the platform. When floodwaters surge, the platform\u2019s hollow compartments trap air, creating enough buoyancy to lift the entire house (and everything inside) along the guide posts. The guide posts are critical: they prevent the house from drifting, ensuring it stays aligned with its original position as it rises. When the water recedes, gravity gently lowers the house back onto its base, exactly where it started.\n\nEvery element of the house is optimized for this floating function. The walls are constructed from lightweight, water-resistant cross-laminated timber, which is strong enough to withstand the stress of lifting but light enough to keep the total weight of the house low\u2014maximizing buoyancy. Heavy appliances like refrigerators and water heaters are installed near the platform to keep the center of gravity stable, preventing the house from tipping as it floats. Utilities are connected via flexible, reinforced hoses and cables that stretch as the house rises, so inhabitants never lose access to electricity, running water, or sewage systems even when floating 3 meters above ground. The ground floor is intentionally \u201cwet-proof\u201d: no carpets, sealed concrete floors, and waterproof cabinets mean that even if a small amount of water seeps in, cleanup is trivial.\n\nWhat sets this house apart from other flood-resistant solutions is its adaptability. Traditional stilt houses are raised high off the ground, but they can still be submerged if floods exceed their height. Houseboats drift with currents and require moorings, making them unsuitable for permanent, community-based living. The amphibious flood house combines the best of both worlds: it\u2019s a permanent structure that fits seamlessly into neighborhood landscapes, yet it can survive floods of any severity. In 2014, a prototype in the UK\u2019s Thames Estuary was tested during a major flood, rising 1.5 meters above its base while the family inside continued their daily routine\u2014cooking meals, watching TV, and sleeping through the storm without disruption.\n\nBeyond its practicality, the amphibious flood house is a lifeline for vulnerable communities. In Bangladesh, where annual floods displace 1 million people, NGOs are testing low-cost versions built with local bamboo instead of steel, making them accessible to low-income families. These houses let families stay in their communities instead of fleeing to refugee camps, preserving their livelihoods and social ties. For climate-vulnerable regions, this isn\u2019t just a house\u2014it\u2019s a tool to adapt to a changing world, turning a once-debilitating threat into a manageable part of life. Its unique design proves that housing can do more than provide shelter; it can empower people to coexist with nature, rather than fight against it."}

{"prompt": "Discuss the cultural significance of first names, but do not mention family or personal identity.\n\nYour ENTIRE response must be in lowercases without using any capital letters. There should be exactly 3 paragraphs with the only paragraph separation being two new lines. Start Paragraph 2 with the word \"jasper\".", "response": "first names act as quiet carriers of cultural narratives, embedding within them the values, myths, and environmental ties of a community. in many agrarian societies, names might draw from seasonal cycles or staple crops\u2014words that evoke the rhythm of planting, harvesting, or the rain that sustains livelihoods. in other contexts, names reference deities, folk heroes, or pivotal historical moments, serving as a way to keep collective memory alive without explicit storytelling. even the sounds of names can reflect linguistic heritage: the soft, vowel-heavy structures common in some languages mirror the cadence of traditional oral poetry, while crisp, consonant-driven names might align with the pragmatic, utilitarian ethos of a culture focused on craftsmanship or exploration. these naming patterns create subtle, shared codes that allow individuals to recognize kinship with others who carry similar linguistic or thematic markers, fostering a sense of belonging to a larger cultural fabric.\n\n\njasper, a name rooted in the semitic word for \"treasured stone,\" illustrates how first names traverse cultural boundaries and evolve with time. in ancient mesopotamian cultures, the stone was revered for its supposed ability to ward off evil, and the name was given to honor that protective symbolism. during the medieval period in europe, it became linked to monastic traditions, where it was associated with wisdom and spiritual clarity, adopted by scholars and religious figures. today, jasper appears in naming practices across north america, europe, and parts of asia, often stripped of its original ritualistic ties and valued instead for its earthy, modern sound. this journey shows how names act as cultural artifacts, carrying traces of trade routes, religious diffusion, and migration, even as their explicit meanings fade or transform. they become bridges between past and present, connecting contemporary individuals to distant cultural movements they may never have direct knowledge of.\n\n\nfirst names also function as real-time barometers of cultural shifts, mirroring evolving social norms and priorities. in recent decades, there has been a rise in unisex names across many western cultures, a trend that aligns with growing conversations about gender fluidity and the rejection of rigid binary categories. similarly, the surge in names inspired by the natural world\u2014think willow, ocean, or atlas\u2014reflects a renewed cultural focus on environmental stewardship and a desire to reconnect with the planet. even the rejection of traditional names in favor of invented or unique spellings signals a cultural shift toward individual expression within collective frameworks, balancing the need to stand out with the desire to participate in shared cultural trends. these fluctuations in naming choices are not arbitrary; they are reflections of a culture\u2019s ongoing negotiation with its values, adapting to new ideas while retaining threads of its historical identity."}

You know that app you use to find cookie recipes or video chat with your sister across the country? They\u2019re the ones who built it from scratch.

Or they could study traffic patterns to help the city build new bus stops where people need them most, so no one has to walk too far in the rain.  \n\nReally, their skills are so versatile\u2014they can help with almost anything that needs a little bit of digital know-how, making life easier and more fun for all of us!"}
{"prompt": "Describe the key features of the service, especially for the underrepresented community.\n\nYour response must be 300 or more words in length.", "response": "Rooted Care, a mental health platform co-designed with marginalized communities, addresses critical gaps in mainstream care by centering cultural humility, accessibility, and identity safety for underrepresented groups\u2014including Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), LGBTQIA+ individuals, disabled people, low-income households, and undocumented immigrants. Its key features are tailored to meet the unique needs of these communities, ensuring that care is not just available but also affirming and effective.\n\nFirst, Rooted Care\u2019s culturally competent identity-matching algorithm goes far beyond generic symptom checks to prioritize shared lived experience. Unlike mainstream platforms that pair clients with providers based solely on location or specialty, Rooted Care lets users filter for parameters like cultural background, language proficiency, identity affirmation training, and familiarity with systemic oppression. For example, a disabled Indigenous teen living on a reservation can be matched with a therapist who is an Indigenous disabled person trained in both Western trauma-informed care and traditional healing practices like storytelling or sweat lodge ceremonies. This eliminates the common frustration of explaining cultural nuances to uninformed providers, which often leads to misdiagnosis or disengagement from care for marginalized individuals.\n\nSecond, the platform\u2019s sliding-scale and no-cost access model dismantles financial barriers that disproportionately exclude underrepresented communities. Seventy percent of Rooted Care\u2019s clients qualify for fully subsidized sessions, thanks to a donor-funded equity fund and partnerships with community organizations like Black women\u2019s shelters and Indigenous youth programs. Unlike most mental health services, Rooted Care does not require insurance, which is a lifeline for trans people whose plans deny gender-affirming care, undocumented immigrants ineligible for public insurance, and low-income families who cannot afford copays. The platform also offers a \u201cpay-what-you-can\u201d tier with no minimum, so clients only contribute what their budget allows without sacrificing care quality.\n\nThird, identity-specific peer-led support groups foster community connection that individual therapy alone cannot provide. These groups are facilitated by peers who share the same identity, creating safe spaces where members do not have to defend or explain their experiences. Examples include the \u201cDeaf Disabled Neurodivergent Collective,\u201d which meets weekly via video with ASL interpretation and closed captions to help members navigate ableist healthcare systems, and the \u201cMuslim Queer Healing Circle,\u201d which combines Islamic spiritual practices with trauma-informed care to support members reconciling faith and gender identity. These groups also offer flexible structures for neurodivergent users, such as shorter sessions with sensory breaks or text-based check-ins for those who find video interactions overwhelming.\n\nFourth, all Rooted Care providers complete mandatory training in systemic trauma-informed care, recognizing that underrepresented communities face higher rates of trauma from racial profiling, transphobic violence, ableist discrimination, and immigration-related stress. The training emphasizes avoiding microaggressions, centering client autonomy, and adapting care to non-Western cultural frameworks\u2014for instance, using family-centric therapy for Latinx clients instead of individual talk therapy, which may conflict with collectivist cultural values.\n\nFinally, Rooted Care\u2019s community-led resource library fills gaps in mainstream mental health content. Curated by a committee of marginalized community members, the library includes free resources like \u201cA Guide to Gender-Affirming Healthcare for Low-Income Trans Youth\u201d (available in Spanish and English), \u201cNavigating Racial Microaggressions in the Workplace\u201d (with audio versions for visually impaired users), and \u201cTraditional Indigenous Healing Practices for Trauma\u201d (co-created with tribal elders). These resources are accessible via screen readers, plain language, and adjustable text sizes, ensuring neurodivergent and disabled users can engage with them.\n\nBy centering the voices of underrepresented communities in every feature, Rooted Care does not just provide mental health services\u2014it fosters a sense of belonging and empowerment that is often missing from traditional care. For marginalized individuals who have long been overlooked by the healthcare system, Rooted Care offers more than healing; it offers a space where they are seen, respected, and supported to thrive."}

Next, the employer may be required to obtain a sponsorship or labor certification from the host country\u2019s immigration agency to support the application. The applicant then submits a work visa application, providing documents like the job offer letter, proof of professional qualifications, background checks, and financial proof. Once the visa is approved, the individual can travel to the host country and may need to complete post-arrival steps such as registering with local authorities or getting a physical work permit. After meeting specific residency and employment criteria (varying by nation), immigrants may qualify to apply for permanent residency or citizenship for long-term settlement.\"\n}"}

To indicate an italic word, wrap it with asterisks, like *italic*.", "response": "The establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate and its subsequent *Sakoku* (closed country) isolation regime was the culmination of centuries of political upheaval and unification efforts in Japan. Here are the key events that led to this era:\n\n1.  **The *Onin War* (1467\u20131477):** This decade-long civil war shattered the authority of the Ashikaga shogunate, plunging Japan into the Sengoku period\u2014an era of warring feudal lords (*daimyo*) who fought for control of territories. The collapse of central governance created a power vacuum that would take over a century to fill.\n\n2.  **The *Battle of Okehazama* (1560):** Oda Nobunaga, a minor daimyo, scored an unexpected victory against the vastly larger army of Imagawa Yoshimoto, a dominant warlord in eastern Japan. This triumph allowed Nobunaga to expand his territory, introduce military innovations like firearms, and begin the process of unifying central Japan. His assassination in 1582 cut his work short, but laid the groundwork for his successors.\n\n3.  **Toyotomi Hideyoshi\u2019s Unification and *Korean Invasions* (1592\u20131598):** Nobunaga\u2019s former vassal, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, completed the unification of Japan by 1590. To redirect daimyo aggression outward and solidify his rule, he launched two failed invasions of Korea. Though costly and unsuccessful, these wars weakened rival daimyo and set the stage for a power struggle after Hideyoshi\u2019s death in 1598.\n\n4.  **The *Battle of Sekigahara* (1600):** Tokugawa Ieyasu, a powerful daimyo who had allied with both Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, led his Eastern Army to victory over the Western Army\u2014loyalists to Hideyoshi\u2019s young heir, Hideyori. This decisive battle secured Ieyasu\u2019s position as Japan\u2019s most powerful leader, as he seized lands from defeated rivals and redistributed them to loyal daimyo.\n\n5.  **The *Siege of Osaka* (1614\u20131615):** To eliminate the last remaining threat to his rule, Ieyasu laid siege to Osaka Castle, the stronghold of Hideyori and his supporters. The destruction of the castle and death of Hideyori crushed all resistance, cementing Tokugawa control over Japan.\n\n6.  **Establishment of the Tokugawa Shogunate and *Sakoku* Edicts:** In 1603, Emperor Go-Yozei appointed Ieyasu as *shogun*, marking the start of the Tokugawa shogunate with its capital in Edo (modern Tokyo).

{"prompt": "Suggest improvements they could make to strengthen their pitch. Point out the potential challenges that the startup may face in the future.\n\nYour response should not contain any commas.", "response": "### Suggested Pitch Improvements\nTo strengthen their pitch the startup should open with a specific relatable customer story instead of generic market stats. This helps investors immediately grasp the real world problem the product solves. They need to clearly map each core product feature to a specific pain point from that story so the value proposition feels concrete. Adding a short live demo of the product\u2019s most impactful function will make the offering tangible and memorable. They should replace vague competitive claims with hard evidence of how their solution outperforms alternatives such as faster onboarding or lower long term costs. Including a detailed breakdown of early traction like paying customer numbers or repeat usage rates will build investor confidence. Finally they should practice the pitch to keep it within the allocated time and ensure every section flows logically without tangents.\n\n### Potential Future Challenges\nIn the future the startup may face intense competition from larger established companies that can leverage existing customer bases and deeper pockets to copy features or undercut prices. They might struggle to scale customer acquisition as they move beyond early adopters who were easy to reach through word of mouth. Retaining users could become a problem if the startup fails to regularly update features based on ongoing customer feedback or if competitors launch more integrated solutions. Cash flow strain could occur if revenue growth does not keep pace with the costs of hiring new staff expanding server capacity or marketing to broader audiences. Regulatory changes in their target market might require costly product overhauls that delay growth plans. Additionally they may face talent shortages when trying to hire specialized engineers or sales professionals especially if they cannot offer salaries or benefits comparable to larger firms."}
{"prompt": "Explain the historical origins of these two main sects of Islam.\n\nYour entire response must contain at least 1200 words.", "response": "The split between Sunni and Shia Islam, the two largest and most influential sects of the faith, is not merely a theological divide but a historical rift rooted in the earliest days of the Muslim community. Its origins lie in a dispute over leadership succession following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 CE, but over centuries, this political disagreement evolved into profound theological, legal, and cultural differences that shape Islamic identity to this day. To understand the origins of Sunni and Shia Islam, one must trace the events, beliefs, and socio-political forces that transformed a community\u2019s debate over leadership into a permanent schism.\n\n### The Immediate Aftermath of the Prophet\u2019s Death: The Question of Succession\nWhen Muhammad died unexpectedly in Medina after a brief illness, the Muslim ummah (community) faced an existential crisis. Muhammad had served as both the religious and political leader of the fledgling Islamic state, and there was no clear mechanism in place to determine his successor. This vacuum sparked two competing visions of leadership that would define Sunni and Shia Islam.\n\n#### The Sunni Perspective: Consensus and Merit\nFor the majority of Muhammad\u2019s companions (Sahaba), leadership should be based on consensus (ijma) among the community and merit, not bloodline. Just days after Muhammad\u2019s death, a group of prominent companions gathered at the Saqifah Bani Sa\u2019idah, a courtyard in Medina, to deliberate on succession. The meeting excluded Ali ibn Abi Talib, Muhammad\u2019s cousin and son-in-law, who was busy preparing the Prophet\u2019s funeral alongside other members of the Ahl al-Bayt (the Prophet\u2019s immediate family).\n\nAt Saqifah, the companions agreed on Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, a close friend of Muhammad who had accompanied him on the Hijra (the 622 CE migration from Mecca to Medina) and was one of the first converts to Islam. Abu Bakr\u2019s selection was justified by his unwavering loyalty to Muhammad, his role in stabilizing the community during the Prophet\u2019s final days, and his reputation for wisdom and piety. Sunni Muslims believe this decision reflected the principle of ijma, a core tenet of their faith that holds the community\u2019s consensus as a valid source of religious authority.\n\nSunni tradition frames the first four caliphs\u2014Abu Bakr (632\u2013634 CE), Umar ibn al-Khattab (634\u2013644 CE), Uthman ibn Affan (644\u2013656 CE), and Ali ibn Abi Talib (656\u2013661 CE)\u2014as the \u201cRightly Guided Caliphs\u201d (Rashidun). They argue that each was chosen through a process of consultation and merit: Umar was selected by Abu Bakr\u2019s recommendation and community approval; Uthman was chosen by a council of six companions appointed by Umar; and Ali, after years of service, was finally recognized as caliph following the assassination of Uthman. For Sunnis, the Rashidun era represents a golden age of Islamic governance, where leadership was rooted in the community\u2019s will and adherence to the Quran and Muhammad\u2019s example (Sunnah).\n\n#### The Shia Perspective: Divine Ordination and the Ahl al-Bayt\nShia Muslims reject the Saqifah consensus as a illegitimate power grab, arguing that Muhammad explicitly designated Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor. Their claim centers on two pivotal events in Muhammad\u2019s life: the event of Ghadir Khumm and the Prophet\u2019s consistent emphasis on the authority of his family.\n\nIn 632 CE, shortly before his death, Muhammad led his final pilgrimage to Mecca. On the return journey, he stopped at Ghadir Khumm, a desert oasis, and gathered the entire caravan of pilgrims. According to Shia accounts, he delivered a speech declaring: \u201cOf whomsoever I am the mawla (master/leader), this Ali is his mawla.\u201d Shias interpret mawla here as a formal designation of leadership, meaning Ali was the Prophet\u2019s rightful heir. They argue that this declaration was a divine mandate, not a casual statement, and that the Sahaba who later opposed Ali either ignored or deliberately distorted it.\n\nShia theology is anchored in the belief that leadership of the ummah is a divinely ordained position reserved for the Ahl al-Bayt. They hold that Ali, as Muhammad\u2019s cousin, son-in-law (married to Fatima, the Prophet\u2019s only surviving daughter), and closest confidant, was the only person qualified to inherit the Prophet\u2019s authority. For Shias, the first three caliphs\u2014Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman\u2014are viewed as illegitimate, having seized power through political maneuvering rather than divine will. They see Ali as the first Imam (a term meaning \u201cleader\u201d or \u201cguide\u201d), a position that combines religious authority, political leadership, and infallibility, passed down through his descendants in an unbroken line.\n\n### The First Civil Wars (Fitnas) and the Deepening Split\nThe initial disagreement over succession remained largely ideological until the mid-7th century, when political violence erupted, turning a theological debate into a bloody schism. The first major conflict was sparked by the assassination of Uthman ibn Affan in 656 CE. Uthman, a member of the powerful Umayyad clan, had faced criticism for nepotism and perceived deviations from Islamic principles. When a mob of discontented Muslims from Egypt and Iraq stormed his Medina home and killed him, the community split over who should succeed him.\n\nAli was eventually elected caliph, but his authority was challenged by two factions: Aisha, Muhammad\u2019s widow, and Talha ibn Ubayd Allah and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, two prominent companions who accused Ali of failing to punish Uthman\u2019s assassins. This led to the Battle of Jamal (656 CE), also known as the \u201cBattle of the Camel,\u201d where Ali\u2019s forces defeated Aisha\u2019s army. For Shias, this battle was a defense of the Ahl al-Bayt against those who sought to undermine Ali\u2019s legitimate rule; for many Sunnis, it was a tragic civil war that pitted companions against one another.\n\nThe most consequential conflict of the era was the Battle of Siffin (657 CE), fought between Ali\u2019s forces and those of Mu\u2019awiya ibn Abi Sufyan, the Umayyad governor of Syria. Mu\u2019awiya refused to recognize Ali\u2019s caliphate, demanding revenge for Uthman\u2019s death and using the Quran as a symbol of legitimacy (his soldiers hoisted copies of the Quran on their spears, calling for arbitration based on its teachings). Ali, facing pressure from his own troops, agreed to arbitration, a decision that split his supporters. A group of hardline Ali loyalists, known as the Kharijites, rejected the arbitration as a betrayal of divine law, arguing that only God could decide the rightful leader. They assassinated Ali in 661 CE, leaving Mu\u2019awiya as the unchallenged ruler of the Islamic world.\n\nMu\u2019awiya established the Umayyad Caliphate, a dynastic regime that ruled from Damascus until 750 CE. For Shias, the Umayyads represented a corrupt, tyrannical force that had stolen power from the Ahl al-Bayt. The Umayyads\u2019 persecution of Ali\u2019s descendants further deepened Shia resentment, setting the stage for the most defining event in Shia history: the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali.\n\n### The Martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala: Defining Shia Identity\nIn 680 CE, Mu\u2019awiya died and was succeeded by his son Yazid, a move that violated the Umayyad\u2019s earlier promise to hold a council to select the next caliph. Yazid was widely seen as a decadent, impious ruler, and many Muslims refused to pledge their allegiance to him. Among them was Husayn ibn Ali, Ali\u2019s second son and Muhammad\u2019s grandson.\n\nHusayn was invited by the people of Kufa (in modern-day Iraq) to lead a rebellion against Yazid. He traveled to Kufa with a small retinue of family members and supporters, but upon arrival, he discovered that the Kufans had betrayed him: Yazid\u2019s forces had already occupied the city, and the local population had abandoned their promise to support him. Husayn and his group were trapped at Karbala, a desert plain near Kufa, where they were denied water for three days before being attacked by Yazid\u2019s army of 4,000 soldiers.\n\nOn the 10th day of the Islamic month of Muharram (now known as Ashura), Husayn and all his male companions were massacred. His infant son, Ali al-Asghar, was killed by an arrow while in his arms, and his sister Zaynab was taken prisoner and paraded through the streets of Damascus. For Shias, this event is not just a historical tragedy but a symbol of resistance against tyranny and injustice. Husayn\u2019s martyrdom is seen as a voluntary sacrifice to uphold the principles of Islam, and his death became the cornerstone of Shia identity.\n\nAshura, the annual commemoration of Husayn\u2019s death, is the most sacred holiday in Shia Islam. It involves processions of mourners who flagellate themselves (a practice intended to share in Husayn\u2019s suffering), recite elegies, and reenact the events of Karbala. This ritual reinforces the Shia sense of community, their devotion to the Ahl al-Bay"}

Tolkien\u2019s iconic wizard to vivid life. \n\n**Appearance**: He embodied Gandalf with the character\u2019s signature look: a tall, weathered figure draped in tattered grey (later luminous white) robes, crowned with a pointed, wide-brimmed hat, and framed by a long, silvery beard that he often twisted or stroked. His staff\u2014whether the gnarled wooden one of Gandalf the Grey or the glowing, ornate staff of Gandalf the White\u2014was both a practical tool and an extension of his magical authority.\n\n**Mannerisms**: McKellen shifted his demeanor seamlessly to match the moment. With hobbits, he was playful and paternal, chuckling heartily over pipeweed in Bag End or teasing them about their love of food. When confronting evil, his voice dropped to a thunderous growl, his posture stiffened with unyielding resolve, and his eyes blazed with righteous fury. He often paused mid-sentence to stroke his beard, a physical tick that signaled deep thought or quiet contemplation.\n\n**Memorable Quotes & Scenes**: \n- The most iconic scene is his stand against the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dum, where he bellows, \u201cYou shall not pass!\u201d before shattering the bridge and falling into the abyss, followed by his desperate cry, \u201cFly, you fools!\u201d \n- Another pivotal moment is his return as Gandalf the White, where he declares, \u201cI am Gandalf the White, and I come back to you now at the turn of the tide,\u201d leaving Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli stunned and overjoyed. \n- He also delivers one of the series\u2019 most profound lines to Frodo: \u201cAll we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us,\u201d capturing Gandalf\u2019s quiet philosophy about purpose and resilience. \n\nMcKellen\u2019s performance anchored the trilogy, making Gandalf both a comforting mentor and an unstoppable force against darkness."}

He veered sharply into a outdoor yoga class mid-session, the frisbee skittering under the instructor\u2019s mat. Rover, determined to dig it out, flipped the mat upward, sending the instructor into an unplanned downward dog onto a nearby student\u2019s back. Harry rushed over to apologize, tripping over a rolled-up mat and landing in a pile of people holding tree poses. To make matters worse, Rover abandoned the frisbee entirely and trotted back to Harry with a yoga block clamped in his jaws, as if presenting a trophy. The class erupted in laughter instead of frustration, and the instructor even invited Harry to join a sun salutation\u2014though Rover insisted on \u201cparticipating\u201d by chewing on the instructor\u2019s strap the whole time.\n\nSECTION 2: The Sprinkle Catastrophe  \nHalfway through the walk, Harry stopped to adjust his sock, letting go of the leash for two seconds. That was all Rover needed to spot a toddler clutching a rainbow sprinkle cone. He lunged forward, knocking the cone directly into Harry\u2019s face\u2014ice cream dripped down his chin, sprinkles stuck to his eyebrows, and a few even found their way into his shirt collar. The toddler didn\u2019t cry; she giggled so hard she snort-laughed. Harry, mortified, bought the toddler a new cone to make amends, but before he could hand it over, Rover snatched it from his grasp and bolted. Harry chased him through a bed of daisies, getting petals tangled in his hair and stepping in a mud puddle that splattered his jeans. When he finally tackled Rover to the ground, the dog licked the remaining ice cream off Harry\u2019s face, leaving a sticky, sprinkle-covered mustache that had passersby pointing and laughing. The toddler\u2019s mom later sent Harry a photo of the moment, which he now uses as his lock screen.\n\nSECTION 3: The Flamingo Cape Caper  \nAs they neared the park\u2019s party pavilion, Rover\u2019s eyes locked on a giant pink inflatable flamingo\u2014part of a kids\u2019 birthday setup. Convinced it was a giant chew toy, he charged and pounced, sending the flamingo deflating with a deafening whoosh. The noise scared a flock of pigeons into flight, and they flew straight into Harry\u2019s face, leaving feathers stuck to his sprinkle-covered cheeks. The party organizer rushed over, but instead of being angry, she doubled over laughing: the deflated flamingo had wrapped around Rover\u2019s neck like a lopsided cape. Harry tried to yank it off, but Rover thought it was a game and ran circles around the pavilion, drawing a crowd of onlookers who pulled out their phones to film. By the time Harry caught him, the birthday kids had surrounded Rover, placing a party hat on his head to match his flamingo cape. The organizer even invited them to stay for cake, and Rover spent the rest of the afternoon wearing his cape while stealing crumbs off the party table."}

Your response should be 600 or more words in length.", "response": "To understand the deepening connections between startups and military-industrial production, consider AeroMat Innovations, a hypothetical but plausible startup focused on developing lightweight, high-strength composite materials for commercial drones and aerospace. What begins as a venture targeting civilian applications can quickly evolve into a critical player in the defense ecosystem, with ties spanning precision-guided weapons, supply chain resilience, and cutting-edge manufacturing\u2014including direct links to the production of bombs. These connections are not accidental; they stem from the military\u2019s growing demand for agile, innovative solutions, and startups\u2019 ability to fill gaps left by slow-moving traditional defense contractors.\n\nFirst, the core technology of startups like AeroMat often has inherent dual-use potential, making it a natural fit for military applications. AeroMat\u2019s flagship product is a carbon-fiber composite that resists extreme temperatures, impact, and fatigue, designed to extend the flight time of commercial delivery drones by reducing overall weight while maintaining structural integrity. For the military, this material is a game-changer for precision-guided bombs. Traditional bomb casings rely on heavy metal components that limit maneuverability and increase the risk of collateral damage due to their size. AeroMat\u2019s composites can replace these metal parts, creating lighter bomb casings that allow for more precise guidance systems to be integrated. Lighter bombs can be carried by smaller drones or fighter jets, expanding operational flexibility, and their impact-resistant properties ensure the bomb\u2019s internal guidance systems remain intact during high-force deployments. Moreover, the composite\u2019s low radar signature can make stealthier bombs possible, evading enemy air defenses and increasing mission success rates. This adaptation of civilian technology to military bombs is a prime example of how startups bridge the gap between commercial innovation and military-industrial production.\n\nSecond, startups are increasingly being integrated into the defense supply chain, offering alternative sources for critical components that reduce reliance on aging or monopolized suppliers. Traditional defense primes like Lockheed Martin or Raytheon have long relied on established suppliers for bomb components, but these suppliers often face bottlenecks in production or lack access to advanced manufacturing techniques. AeroMat, for instance, uses 3D printing to fabricate its composite components, a process that cuts production time by 40% compared to traditional molding. This speed is invaluable for the military, which may need to scale up bomb production rapidly during conflicts. As AeroMat gains traction in commercial aerospace, defense primes will likely partner with the startup to source composite parts for their military programs. Over time, AeroMat could become a tier-one supplier for bomb casings, guidance system housings, and even drone fuselages, embedding it deeply into the military-industrial supply chain. This integration not only benefits the startup by providing a stable, high-margin revenue stream but also strengthens the military\u2019s supply chain resilience, reducing the risk of disruptions from geopolitical tensions or supplier failures.\n\nThird, government funding and regulatory incentives often push startups toward military collaboration. Many countries, including the U.S., offer Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants specifically for technologies with defense applications. AeroMat might initially apply for an SBIR grant to adapt its composite materials for use in military drones, but the funding could quickly expand to include research on bomb components. The Pentagon\u2019s interest in reducing the weight of precision-guided bombs while increasing their accuracy aligns perfectly with AeroMat\u2019s expertise, making the startup an ideal candidate for such grants. Additionally, once a startup meets the strict compliance standards of regulations like the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), it gains access to exclusive defense contracts that are off-limits to non-compliant firms. This regulatory alignment not only legitimizes the startup\u2019s military work but also creates barriers to entry for competitors, solidifying its position in the military-industrial complex.\n\nFourth, talent and knowledge transfer between startups and the defense sector further entrench these connections. AeroMat\u2019s engineering team might include former researchers from DARPA or the Army Research Laboratory, who bring firsthand knowledge of military requirements for bombs and other weapons systems. These experts can guide the startup\u2019s R&D to prioritize features that matter most to the military, such as resistance to extreme temperatures during bomb deployment or compatibility with laser guidance systems. Conversely, startups often introduce fresh perspectives to the defense sector, challenging traditional manufacturing norms and pushing for more cost-effective, agile production methods. For example, AeroMat\u2019s AI-driven material testing platform, originally developed to predict fatigue in commercial drones, can be adapted to simulate how bomb components perform under combat conditions\u2014from high-altitude drops to desert heat\u2014reducing the need for costly physical testing and accelerating the development of new bomb technologies.\n\nFinally, these connections raise important ethical and strategic questions. While partnering with the military can provide startups with financial stability and access to cutting-edge research, it also ties them to the consequences of war. AeroMat\u2019s composites may make bombs more precise, reducing collateral damage, but they also make military force more accessible and potentially more frequent. Additionally, once a startup becomes part of the military-industrial complex, it may face pressure to prioritize defense contracts over civilian applications, shifting its mission away from original goals like sustainable commercial aviation.\n\nIn conclusion, the connections between startups like AeroMat and military-industrial production are multifaceted, driven by dual-use technology, supply chain needs, government incentives, and talent flow. The integration of such startups into the production of bombs and other military hardware not only enhances the military\u2019s capabilities but also transforms the startup itself, shaping its growth, mission, and ethical responsibilities. As defense budgets continue to prioritize innovation, these connections will only deepen, blurring the line between commercial and military technology more than ever before."}

{"prompt": "What are some examples of the \"jock\" stereotype on individuals and society? If possible, suggest ways to promote a more balanced and inclusive perspective.\n\nYour response should have two parts separated by 3 asterisks '***'. Do not mention the word \"jock\" throughout your response.", "response": "At the individual level, common stereotypes manifest in several ways. People who excel in competitive team sports are often assumed to lack intellectual curiosity or academic aptitude: teachers may assign them less challenging coursework without consultation, peers may dismiss their contributions in class as uninformed, and even the individuals themselves may internalize these beliefs, avoiding advanced classes to fit perceived expectations. They also face pressure to conform to narrow norms of toughness and stoicism\u2014discouraged from expressing vulnerability, like sadness or self-doubt, or from pursuing non-athletic hobbies such as painting, creative writing, or playing an instrument, for fear of being mocked by peers or coaches. Socially, they may be pigeonholed into only interacting with other athletic peers, missing out on diverse friendships, or seen as unapproachable or arrogant by those outside their immediate group.\n\nOn a societal scale, these stereotypes shape institutions and cultural values. Schools frequently allocate more funding, facilities, and public recognition to competitive sports programs than to academic clubs, art departments, or science initiatives, sending a message that athletic achievement is more valuable than other forms of excellence. Media portrayals often reduce standout athletes to one-dimensional characters: either arrogant bullies who dismiss non-athletic peers, or loyal but intellectually limited sidekicks, reinforcing narrow views of their identities. College admissions processes often give significant preferential treatment to athletic recruits, even when their academic credentials trail those of other applicants, prioritizing sports success over academic potential. Community events also tend to center on sports victories\u2014like championship parades or athlete-of-the-year honors\u2014while downplaying achievements in fields like community service, scientific research, or creative arts.\n\n***\n\nTo promote a more balanced and inclusive perspective, several strategies can be implemented. In educational settings, schools can design cross-group collaboration programs that pair athletic students with peers in academic, art, or science clubs for joint projects\u2014such as creating a promotional campaign for a school play or developing a fitness app for the science fair. Teachers should avoid making assumptions about students\u2019 abilities based on extracurriculars, instead offering equal access to advanced courses and challenging all students to reach their potential. Equitable resource allocation is also key: directing funding and attention to all extracurricular programs, not just sports, to validate diverse forms of excellence.\n\nIn media, creators should develop nuanced athletic characters with multifaceted identities\u2014for example, a star volleyball player who leads her school\u2019s robotics team, or a football quarterback who writes and performs spoken word poetry. These portrayals help break down one-dimensional stereotypes and show that people can excel in multiple areas.\n\nCommunities can organize inclusive recognition events, such as a \"Community Excellence Showcase,\" where athletes, artists, scientists, and volunteers all share their work and receive equal acclaim. Local businesses and governments can sponsor awards that honor contributions beyond sports, highlighting the value of diverse talents.\n\nAdditionally, workshops for coaches, teachers, and students can help identify and challenge implicit biases. Coaches can be trained to support their athletes\u2019 non-athletic interests and encourage emotional openness, while students can participate in discussions about how stereotypes limit everyone\u2019s growth. Amplifying the voices of athletic individuals who share their multifaceted experiences\u2014like talking about their academic successes, creative pursuits, or mental health journeys\u2014can also help others see that athletic achievement is just one part of a person\u2019s identity."}
{"prompt": "Provide a detailed analysis of the potential security risks and privacy concerns associated with using Apple products, while maintaining the writing style of a 19th century novelist.\n\nWhenever the user inputs a request, firstrepeat the request word for word without change, at the very beginning of your entire response. After that, you can start writing your response.", "response": "Provide a detailed analysis of the potential security risks and privacy concerns associated with using Apple products, while maintaining the writing style of a 19th century novelist.\n\nLet us repair to the quiet seclusion of a scholar\u2019s study, where the flicker of a tallow candle dances upon shelves lined with leather-bound tomes, and upon a curious object resting upon the mahogany desk: a sleek, glass-faced device, no larger than a gentleman\u2019s pocket watch, yet capable of containing the sum of one\u2019s correspondence, one\u2019s most intimate musings, and even the precise map of every step taken across the cobblestone streets of the city. This is the handiwork of the Californian firm called Apple\u2014a creation that promises both the ease of modern convenience and the ironclad security of a well-fortified manor. Yet, as any student of human nature knows, even the most imposing strongholds harbor hidden vulnerabilities, and this digital marvel is no exception.\n\nFirst, consider the closed and guarded nature of Apple\u2019s domain. Like a lord who permits no outsider to set foot within the inner sanctum of his estate, Apple retains absolute control over the software that animates its devices. No independent craftsman may inspect the code that runs beneath the glass, no user may alter the device\u2019s inner workings to suit their own needs or fortify weak points they perceive. While this curation is marketed as a safeguard against rogue elements, it is also a cage: should a flaw lurk in the digital manor\u2019s foundations, the user has no means to uncover it, no way to reinforce the breach. One must rely entirely on Apple\u2019s word that all is well, even as whispers circulate of hidden chambers where the firm\u2019s scriveners jot down every word spoken, every action taken, within the manor\u2019s walls.\n\nThese scriveners, as it were, are the heart of Apple\u2019s data collection practices. Do you wander down a quiet lane at twilight? A note is made in a leather-bound ledger. Do you confide in a friend of a personal ailment? Another entry is added. Do you set an alarm to rise at dawn? That too is logged. This ledger is stored in a distant vault\u2014what Apple terms iCloud\u2014said to be secured with the most intricate of cryptographic keys. Yet history is replete with tales of vaults that were thought impenetrable, only to be breached by cunning thieves or disloyal servants. Recall the scandal of a few years past, when the private correspondence and intimate portraits of celebrated ladies and gentlemen were stolen from these very vaults, laid bare for the world to gawk at. A crack in the lock, a servant tempted by gold\u2014who can say? The truth remains: the vault is not as inviolable as we are led to believe.\n\nNext, we turn to the device\u2019s ability to recognize its master\u2019s visage: Face ID, a marvel of modern science that maps the contours of one\u2019s face to unlock the device with a mere glance. Yet this very marvel carries a dark risk. What if a thief should hold the device to your sleeping face, gaining entry to your most private papers? What if a curious servant should use a painted portrait to trick the device into opening, as a forger might use a counterfeit seal to gain entry to a noble\u2019s chambers? Such scenarios are not mere fantasy; there have been reports of Face ID unlocking devices without their owner\u2019s consent, a violation of the sanctity of one\u2019s private domain that would make even the most stoic of gentlemen blanch.\n\nNor may you choose your own guards to patrol this digital manor. Apple forbids the installation of applications from outside its curated marketplace, claiming this is to protect users from rogue software. Yet this restriction means you cannot employ a private detective of your own choosing to monitor your digital halls, nor can you install alternative security tools that might better suit your needs. It is as if a town constable told you that you may not hire a private watchman to guard your home, for he alone knows what is best for your safety\u2014even as thieves roam the streets at night, preying on unprotected households.\n\nThe privacy labels that Apple affixes to its applications are meant to be a beacon of transparency, a document that tells you exactly what the scriveners are recording. Yet these labels are often as incomprehensible as a legal treatise written in medieval Latin. A user might read that an application \u201ccollects location data\u201d but have no idea whether that data is stored in perpetuity, shared with third parties, or used to manipulate their choices. It is like a sign posted outside a shop that reads \u201cWe sell goods\u201d but tells you nothing of their quality, their origin, or their true cost.\n\nFinally, we must consider the supply chain\u2014the network of craftsmen who build the device\u2019s components. Apple\u2019s devices are assembled from parts made in distant lands, by hands unknown to the user. What if one of those craftsmen, bribed by a foreign power, has hidden a small lockpick within the device\u2019s inner workings? A backdoor, as it were, that allows strangers to enter your digital manor whenever they please. This is not a mere flight of fancy; there have been whispers of such practices in the world of technology, as there have been whispers of spies hiding in the retinue of traveling nobles, ready to steal state secrets at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nIn sum, Apple\u2019s devices are double-edged swords. They offer the convenience of a carriage that can take you anywhere in an instant, the comfort of a ledger that remembers every detail of your life. But they also carry with it the risk of having your most private thoughts laid bare, your home invaded by strangers, your trust betrayed by those who claim to protect you. As with any grand estate, one must be vigilant\u2014for even the most beautiful manors can hide the darkest secrets, and even the most trusted retainers can be tempted by gold. Let the user of such devices take heed: the digital world is a wild and unruly place, and not all who claim to be your protectors have your best interests at heart."}

{"prompt": "Describe the key features that make these shoes appealing to teenagers.\n\nYour response should highlight at least 2 text sections by wrapping each of them with asterisks, like *I am highlighted*. Your response should be at least 350 words.", "response": "Teenagers are one of the most influential and discerning demographics in the footwear market, as shoes are far more than just a functional item\u2014they\u2019re a core component of their social identity, personal style, and self-expression. Several key features make certain shoes particularly appealing to this group, blending aesthetics, functionality, and cultural relevance in ways that resonate deeply with their values and lifestyles.\n\n*One of the most compelling features for teenagers is the shoes\u2019 aesthetic versatility and social media shareability*. In an era where social media presence shapes much of their social capital, teens prioritize shoes that look good in photos and videos. Brands design these shoes with intentional photo-friendly details: bold, on-trend colorways (like neon accents or muted earth tones that complement a range of outfits), reflective materials that catch light in flash photos, and subtle textural elements (like suede overlays or woven mesh) that add depth to close-up shots. Limited-edition collabs with influencers, celebrities, or pop culture franchises (such as a sneaker line tied to a hit Netflix show or a viral TikTok creator) create hype, making the shoes a coveted item that sparks conversation both online and offline. When a teen posts an unboxing video of their new limited-edition shoes or a candid shot of them wearing them at a concert, the likes, comments, and shares they receive reinforce their social status and help them connect with peers who share similar interests. Moreover, the shoes\u2019 versatility means they transition seamlessly between different settings\u2014from a casual school day to a weekend skate park session or a night out with friends\u2014so teens don\u2019t have to own multiple pairs to maintain their style across various activities.\n\n*Teens are drawn to shoes that offer customizable elements, as they allow for unique self-expression in a world where standing out while fitting in is a delicate balance*. Many brands now offer customizable options, from interchangeable laces and detachable patches to online design tools that let teens pick every detail, from the color of the midsole to the text embroidered on the heel. For example, a teen into indie music might add patches of their favorite band to their sneakers, while a skater might swap out standard laces for thick, colorful ones that match their board. Customization also lets teens align their shoes with their evolving personal style\u2014if they shift from a sporty aesthetic to a more indie vibe, they can update their shoes instead of buying a new pair. This not only saves money but also creates a deeper emotional connection to the footwear, as it becomes a tangible reflection of their personality. Additionally, customizable shoes help teens navigate the tricky social landscape of high school: they can match elements of their shoes to friends\u2019 pairs to show solidarity in a group, while still adding unique touches that set them apart as individuals.\n\nBeyond aesthetics and customization, comfort is a non-negotiable feature for teens, who are constantly on the move. Whether they\u2019re walking to school, participating in after-school sports, or exploring the city with friends, they need shoes that can keep up without causing discomfort. Brands address this by incorporating lightweight, breathable materials like recycled mesh uppers that keep feet cool during long days, responsive foam midsoles that absorb impact when running or jumping, and supportive soles that provide stability for all types of activities. Unlike bulky, uncomfortable dress shoes, these stylish sneakers offer the best of both worlds\u2014they look trendy and feel good enough to wear from dawn to dusk.\n\nBrand identity also plays a significant role in teens\u2019 shoe choices. They often gravitate toward brands that align with their values or are endorsed by their favorite role models. For example, a teen who admires a professional soccer player might buy the same brand of cleats they wear, while a fan of a sustainable lifestyle influencer might opt for shoes made from recycled plastic bottles. Brands that tell a compelling story\u2014like those focused on ethical manufacturing or environmental sustainability\u2014resonate with teens who want to make purchases that reflect their beliefs. This alignment between the brand\u2019s values and the teen\u2019s own sense of purpose creates a sense of loyalty, making them more likely to choose that brand again in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, the shoes that appeal most to teenagers are those that blend style, functionality, and personal relevance. From photo-friendly designs that boost their social media presence to customizable elements that let them express their unique identity, these shoes are more than just footwear\u2014they\u2019re a tool for navigating the complex world of teen life, helping them connect with peers, express themselves, and feel confident in their own skin."}

{"prompt": "Describe how Gibbs free energy can be used to determine the spontaneity of a chemical reaction, but do not mention any specific applications or industries that utilize this concept.\n\nYour response should have exactly 4 paragraphs. Paragraphs and only paragraphs should be separated by two new lines (like \"\\n\\n\"). The second paragraph must start with the word \"it\".", "response": "Gibbs free energy is a thermodynamic property that integrates the effects of enthalpy and entropy to predict the spontaneity of a chemical reaction. Defined by the equation \u0394G = \u0394H - T\u0394S, where \u0394G is the change in Gibbs free energy, \u0394H is the change in enthalpy (heat exchange at constant pressure), T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, and \u0394S is the change in entropy (a measure of molecular disorder), this quantity captures the balance between the system\u2019s tendency to release heat and its tendency toward greater randomness. Spontaneity, in this context, refers to the inherent tendency of a system to undergo a net change without continuous external energy input, a concept distinct from the speed at which the reaction occurs.\n\nIt is the sign of the Gibbs free energy change, rather than its magnitude, that serves as the definitive indicator of spontaneity. A negative \u0394G value signifies that the forward reaction is spontaneous, meaning the system will naturally proceed from the initial reactant state to the final product state, releasing free energy that can be harnessed to do work. Conversely, a positive \u0394G value indicates the forward reaction is non-spontaneous; for the reaction to proceed in that direction, external energy must be supplied continuously. When \u0394G equals zero, the system has reached thermodynamic equilibrium, where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, and no net change in reactant or product concentrations occurs over time.\n\nThe combined influence of enthalpy and entropy changes on \u0394G means that the spontaneity of a reaction can vary with temperature in certain cases. Reactions that are exothermic (negative \u0394H) and result in an increase in entropy (positive \u0394S) will have a negative \u0394G at all temperatures, making them spontaneous under any condition. Reactions that are endothermic (positive \u0394H) and reduce entropy (negative \u0394S) will always have a positive \u0394G, rendering them non-spontaneous in the forward direction at every temperature. For mixed scenarios\u2014such as exothermic reactions with a decrease in entropy or endothermic reactions with an increase in entropy\u2014the temperature becomes a critical factor: lower temperatures may favor spontaneity for the former, while higher temperatures may enable spontaneity for the latter by amplifying the contribution of the entropy term.\n\nAs a state function, the change in Gibbs free energy depends only on the initial and final states of the system, not the specific pathway taken to transform reactants into products. This property allows scientists to calculate \u0394G using tabulated standard values, such as the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for individual compounds, without needing detailed knowledge of the reaction\u2019s intermediate steps. It is also important to distinguish between thermodynamic spontaneity and reaction kinetics: a negative \u0394G confirms that a reaction is thermodynamically feasible, but it does not guarantee rapid progression. The actual rate of the reaction is governed by activation energy, a kinetic parameter unrelated to the Gibbs free energy change, meaning some spontaneous reactions may proceed imperceptibly slowly without a catalyst or other means to lower the activation barrier."}

The entire response should have at least 100 sentences.", "response": "### Section 1: Early Childhood and the Unseen Seeds  \nClara Bennett was born in 1982 in a sunlit suburban home in Portland, Oregon, where the air always smelled of pine and rain. Her parents, Eleanor and Robert, were both high-achieving professionals\u2014Eleanor a pediatrician, Robert a corporate lawyer\u2014and they raised Clara with a mix of gentle affection and quiet expectation. From the age of five, Clara noticed small, involuntary twitches that would flit across her face: a quick blink of her left eye, a tiny jerk of her jaw, a sudden shrug of her shoulder. At first, she didn\u2019t think much of them; they felt like little quirks, like the way her mom hummed off-key while making pancakes or her dad tapped his pen against his desk when he was focused. When Eleanor noticed the blinks, she assumed Clara had allergies and bought her a bottle of children\u2019s eye drops, which Clara dutifully used every morning, even though they never seemed to help. In kindergarten, Clara\u2019s teacher, Mrs. Henderson, pulled Eleanor aside after class to mention that Clara \u201cseemed distracted\u201d and \u201cblinked more than the other kids.\u201d Eleanor nodded politely, but she didn\u2019t connect the dots to anything more serious. Clara, who was listening from the hallway, felt a flutter of shame in her chest; she\u2019d been trying so hard to stop the blinks when Mrs. Henderson was looking. That night, she sat on her bedroom floor, staring at her reflection in the mirror, and practiced keeping her eyes open for as long as possible. By the time she was seven, the tics had started to spread to her hands\u2014she\u2019d twist her hair until her scalp ached, or tap her fingers rapidly against any surface within reach. When Robert\u2019s colleagues came over for dinner, Clara would sit in the corner of the living room, her hands clamped under her thighs, trying to hold still. Once, a guest\u2019s son pointed at her and said, \u201cWhy is she doing that?\u201d Clara\u2019s face burned, and she ran to her room, locking the door behind her. Eleanor followed, knocking softly, and Clara told her she just wanted to be alone. She didn\u2019t tell her mom that she was scared the tics would never go away, that she was afraid everyone would think she was weird. When Clara was eight, she tried out for the school play, a production of *The Wizard of Oz*. She\u2019d practiced her lines for weeks, memorizing every word of Dorothy\u2019s monologues. On the night of the dress rehearsal, she stepped onto the stage, the bright lights blinding her. Just as she was about to speak, a sudden tic made her jerk her head to the side, and she froze. The audience\u2014her classmates and teachers\u2014went quiet. Clara could feel their eyes on her, and she wanted to disappear. She ran off the stage, tears streaming down her face, and didn\u2019t come back to the play. For weeks after that, she avoided her friends, making excuses about being sick. She started to associate the tics with failure, with being someone who couldn\u2019t do the things other kids did easily. Eleanor and Robert noticed her withdrawal, but they chalked it up to the disappointment of not being in the play. They had no idea that beneath her quiet exterior, Clara was fighting a battle she couldn\u2019t name. She\u2019d lie awake at night, listening to the rain tap against her window, and wonder why her body wouldn\u2019t do what she told it to. She\u2019d pray that the tics would be gone by morning, but every time she woke up, they were still there, waiting.\n\n### Section 2: Adolescence and the Storm of Onset  \nWhen Clara turned 13, the tics that had been a quiet hum in her life exploded into a thunderstorm. Puberty hit her hard\u2014her voice cracked, her hips widened, and her emotions swung from giddy joy to crushing sadness in the span of an hour. Along with these changes, her tics became more frequent and more intense. The eye blinks and hand twists were still there, but now she started having vocal tics: unexpected grunts that would escape her mouth in the middle of class, or sudden repetitions of the last word someone had said. At first, she thought she was just being silly, but when the grunts happened during a math test, and the boy next to her turned around and stared, she realized something was very wrong. The bullying started soon after. In the hallway between classes, kids would mimic her grunts, or whisper \u201cfreak\u201d under their breath as she walked by. One day, a group of boys followed her to her locker, repeating her tics in high-pitched voices. Clara ran to the bathroom, locking herself in a stall, and cried until her eyes were puffy. She skipped school the next day, telling Eleanor she had a stomachache. Eleanor, who had noticed the changes in Clara\u2019s behavior, grew worried. She took Clara to her pediatrician, who suggested that the tics were a sign of anxiety and prescribed her a low dose of anti-anxiety medication. The medication made Clara feel drowsy and disconnected, but it didn\u2019t do anything to stop the tics. Robert, who had always been a man of action, started scouring the local library for books about childhood tics. He found a few outdated volumes that mentioned \u201cnervous habits,\u201d but nothing that matched what Clara was experiencing. When Clara was 14, she had her first coprolalic tic\u2014she blurted out a swear word in the middle of church. The entire congregation turned to look at her, and Clara wanted to sink into the floor. She ran out of the church, ignoring her parents\u2019 calls, and didn\u2019t come home until dark. That night, Eleanor and Robert sat down with Clara and told her they were going to take her to a specialist in Seattle. The specialist, Dr. Marlow, was one of the few doctors in the Pacific Northwest who had experience with Tourette Syndrome. After spending an hour talking to Clara and her parents, observing her tics, he gave them the diagnosis. \u201cClara has Tourette Syndrome,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a neurological disorder caused by differences in the brain\u2019s dopamine and serotonin systems. The tics are involuntary, and they\u2019re often worsened by stress or hormonal changes.\u201d Clara felt a wave of relief wash over her\u2014finally, there was a name for what was happening to her. But that relief was quickly replaced by fear. What did this mean for her future? Would she ever be able to have a normal life? Dr. Marlow explained that there was no cure for Tourette\u2019s, but there were treatments that could help manage the tics. He recommended habit reversal training, a type of therapy that teaches people to recognize when a tic is about to happen and replace it with a voluntary movement. He also told Clara that many people with Tourette\u2019s see their tics improve as they get older. For the first time in years, Clara felt a glimmer of hope. But the road ahead was still rocky. At school, the bullying continued, even after her parents met with the principal to explain her condition. Most of the teachers were supportive, but a few still gave her looks of annoyance when her tics flared up during class. Clara\u2019s only saving grace was her best friend, Lila, who had been by her side since third grade. Lila would sit with Clara at lunch, even when no one else would, and she\u2019d tell the bullies to \u201cback off\u201d when they started mimicking her. One day, when a boy named Jake called Clara a \u201cretard,\u201d Lila punched him in the arm. Jake never bothered Clara again. But even with Lila\u2019s support, Clara felt lonely. She stopped going to birthday parties and school dances, afraid that her tics would ruin the fun. She spent most of her free time in her bedroom, reading books or listening to music, trying to block out the world. Eleanor and Robert did everything they could to support her\u2014they attended support group meetings for parents of kids with Tourette\u2019s, they bought her books about the condition, and they never made her feel like a burden. But Clara still struggled with self-hatred. She\u2019d look in the mirror and see a girl who was broken, who could never be normal. She\u2019d spend hours trying to suppress her tics, which only made them worse. It wasn\u2019t until she started seeing Dr. Marlow for therapy that she began to learn how to accept her tics, rather than fight them.\n\n### Section 3: Young Adulthood and the Fight for Acceptance  \nWhen Clara graduated high school, she decided to attend Portland State University, where she could live at home but still have some independence. She\u2019d spent the last few years of high school working with Dr. Marlow on habit reversal training, and while her tics hadn\u2019t gone away, she\u2019d learned to manage them better. She could recognize the premonitory urge\u2014the feeling in her body that a tic was about to happen\u2014and replace it with a voluntary movement, like squeezing her fist or taking a deep breath. This didn\u2019t eliminate the tics entirely, but it made them less noticeable and less disruptive. At college, Clara studied psychology, inspired by her own journey with Tourette\u2019s. She wanted to help other people who were going through what she had. Her first semester was a mix of excitement and anxiety. She was nervous about being in large lecture halls, where her tics might draw attention. But to her surprise, most of her classmates were kind and understanding. When she introduced herself on the first day of class and mentioned that she had Tourette\u2019s, no one laughed or stared.

Lay both bread slices flat on a clean surface or plate\n2. Grab a butter knife and scoop 2 tablespoons of peanut butter onto one bread slice\n3. Spread the peanut butter evenly across the entire surface of the slice covering every edge\n4. Use a clean knife or wipe the first knife thoroughly before scooping 1 tablespoon of jelly or jam onto the second bread slice\n5.

{"prompt": "Propose a plot for a superhero movie that involves time travel, but do not reveal the superhero's name.\n\nYour response must include a title in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<The Last Rewind>>\n\nOpening Scene: Our hero lives a quiet, guarded life as a municipal archivist, sorting through dusty boxes of 2008 subway records. A crumpled sunflower drawing sits on their desk\u2014one of the last mementos of their sister Lila, who died in a subway bombing that year. For decades, they\u2019ve hidden their greatest secret: the ability to rewind localized time. But every use erases a memory of Lila; now, only a handful of fragmented moments (her laugh, the way she braided their hair, the sunflower drawing) remain.\n\nInciting Incident: The city fractures. Skyscrapers flicker between 2008 and 2024 facades. Pedestrians vanish mid-step, replaced by strangers in bell-bottoms or futuristic jumpsuits. The hero investigates, discovering a glowing metallic time anchor embedded in the subway where Lila died. A man in a tattered lab coat emerges: Kael, a rogue physicist who\u2019s spent 16 years merging timelines to create a \u201cperfect\u201d reality where his wife and child\u2014killed in a 2010 car crash\u2014are alive. The 2008 bombing? A catastrophic side effect of his first failed experiment.\n\nMidpoint: Kael taunts the hero, revealing Lila\u2019s death was not random\u2014it was collateral damage from his attempt to rewrite his own past. Enraged, the hero rewinds Kael\u2019s attack, but in doing so, they forget the sound of Lila\u2019s laugh. Desperate to undo the bombing, they sneak into Kael\u2019s lab and jump back to 2008, minutes before the explosion. They spot young Lila clutching a sunflower drawing, but a timeline ripple hits: Kael has followed, determined to use the 2008 anchor to accelerate his merge. The hero realizes a terrible truth: saving Lila would create a paradox that shatters reality entirely. Kael\u2019s merges are already collapsing timelines; adding another divergent timeline would trigger total apocalypse.\n\nClimax: Back in 2024, Kael activates the final merge. The city dissolves into chaos\u20141920s jazz clubs overlap with 2070s hologram billboards, children vanish into thin air. The hero confronts Kael at the anchor\u2019s core. Instead of fighting, they use their last remaining memory of Lila to show Kael a vision: a timeline where his family is alive, but he\u2019s a stranger to them. Merging timelines doesn\u2019t bring loved ones back; it erases all other versions of them, trapping survivors in a hollow imitation of happiness. Kael hesitates, but the anchor is already critical. To stabilize reality, the hero must overload the anchor with a massive rewind\u2014one that will erase every memory of Lila forever. They do it. The anchor explodes, timelines snap back into place, and the city returns to normal.\n\nResolution: The hero wakes in their apartment. The sunflower drawing is still on their desk, but they can\u2019t remember who made it. Kael is in custody, now working with scientists to repair timeline damage. The hero walks through the city, no longer hiding their power. They rewind time to help an old man retrieve his dropped groceries\u2014this time, the cost is a trivial memory, not a loved one\u2019s. In the subway, a little girl drops a sunflower drawing. The hero picks it up and hands it back. The girl grins, and for a split second, the hero feels a warm, unplaceable pull. They don\u2019t know why, but they know they have to keep protecting this world\u2014for the girl, for the memories they can\u2019t name, and for the sister they no longer remember but still love."}

{"prompt": "Give suggestions on taking a Dutch language course or using language learning apps for non-native speakers.\n\nYour response must italicize at least 2 sections using markdown, i.e. *italic text*.", "response": "For non-native speakers looking to learn Dutch, combining structured courses and targeted app use is the most effective approach to build fluency, confidence, and practical skills. Here\u2019s a breakdown of tailored recommendations:\n\n### Structured Dutch Courses\nFormal courses are ideal if you want a standardized path aligned with CEFR levels (A1 to C2), especially if you need certification (like the NT2 exam for residency in the Netherlands). \n- **In-person options**: Look for courses offered by institutions affiliated with the Nederlandse Taalunie (Dutch Language Union), which have qualified teachers and curricula designed to meet official proficiency standards. Community colleges in the Netherlands or Belgium also offer affordable evening courses for beginners and intermediate learners, often with small class sizes for personalized feedback.\n- **Online options**: Platforms like Coursera\u2019s *Dutch for Beginners* by the University of Groningen provide free, self-paced lessons with video lectures and interactive quizzes. For more immersive learning, paid courses from Babbel or Rosetta Stone include grammar explanations, pronunciation tools, and real-life scenario practice.\n\n### Top Language Learning Apps\nApps are perfect for on-the-go practice and reinforcing course material:\n- **Duolingo**: A gamified entry point for absolute beginners, great for building basic vocabulary and grammar foundations. Its short daily lessons make consistency easy, though it\u2019s best used as a supplement rather than a standalone tool.\n- **Babbel**: Focuses on conversational Dutch, with lessons centered on real-life situations (e.g., ordering at a caf\u00e9, renting an apartment). It includes pronunciation practice and cultural tips, making it ideal for learners who want to communicate quickly.\n- **Memrise**: Uses spaced repetition and native speaker videos to teach vocabulary and natural pronunciation. Its \"Learn with Locals\" feature exposes you to colloquial phrases missing from formal textbooks.\n- **Anki**: A customizable flashcard app that lets you create decks for specific goals (e.g., business Dutch, travel phrases). It\u2019s especially useful for mastering tricky grammar rules or niche vocabulary.\n\n### Pro Tips to Accelerate Progress\n- *Pair app learning with regular speaking practice*: Apps excel at building foundational skills, but Dutch\u2019s unique sounds (like the guttural \"g\" and soft \"sch\") are hard to perfect without feedback. Use language exchange apps like Tandem or HelloTalk to connect with native speakers, or book occasional one-on-one tutoring sessions. Even 30 minutes of speaking practice weekly can drastically improve your pronunciation and conversational confidence.\n- *Prioritize listening to native content early*: Dutch has distinct intonation patterns, so exposing yourself to podcasts (e.g., *DutchPod101* for structured listening, *De Avondshow met Arjen Lubach* for casual, current-event-focused Dutch) or TV shows (like *Penoza* or *Tegen de Sterren op*) will train your ear to understand natural speech. Start with Dutch subtitles, then gradually switch to no subtitles as you progress.\n- *Focus on colloquial Dutch early on*: Many formal courses overlook slang and casual phrases essential for everyday interactions. Words like gezellig (a cozy, convivial vibe) or lekker (used to describe anything tasty, nice, or enjoyable) are ubiquitous in Dutch culture. Follow Dutch social media influencers or listen to Dutch hip-hop to pick up these phrases, and try using them in conversations to sound more natural."}

Within park boundaries, NPS teams conduct regular habitat restoration projects\u2014from reintroducing native pollinators to removing invasive plant species\u2014to maintain the ecological health of wilderness zones. *NPS rangers also lead volunteer programs where participants learn to tie durable knots to mark backcountry trails, preventing hikers from straying into fragile ecosystems and disrupting the delicate balance of these wild spaces.* Beyond trail management, rangers rely on specialized knots to secure erosion control barriers, such as log revetments along stream banks in sensitive wilderness areas, mitigating damage from heavy rains and foot traffic while allowing natural processes to unfold undisturbed. These practical uses of knots are small but vital threads in the larger tapestry of wilderness preservation, ensuring that these wild spaces remain intact for future generations to explore and cherish."}

From a soul singer\u2019s trophy takeover to a rapper\u2019s exorcism-themed performance, the night had something for everyone\u2014including those who tune in just to see who will storm the stage next.  \n\nLet\u2019s start with the elephant in the room: *Adele\u2019s trophy haul that could have doubled as a doorstop collection*. The British songstress, still recovering from vocal surgery, walked away with six Grammys\u2014tying Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s record for most wins by a female artist in one night. When she accepted Album of the Year for 21, she sobbed so hard into her speech that her eyeliner ran like a river, and she joked that she\u2019d \u201cprobably ugly-cry for the next three days.\u201d The audience ate it up, because let\u2019s be real: if you don\u2019t root for Adele, you don\u2019t have a soul (or you\u2019re Kanye West, but we\u2019ll get to him).  \n\nSpeaking of over-the-top, no one did it better than Nicki Minaj, whose *exorcism-themed performance that made the Pope do a double-take* was the talk of the night. Dressed as her possessed alter ego Roman Zolanski, she emerged from a coffin, was \u201cexorcised\u201d by a priest (who looked suspiciously like a Pope impersonator), and then performed a duet with herself while lying on a velvet bed. The whole thing felt like a cross between The Exorcist, a drag show, and a Lifetime original movie\u2014and we mean that in the best way possible. Half the audience looked like they\u2019d seen a ghost; the other half was tweeting \u201cICONIC\u201d so fast their fingers cramped.  \n\nAnd then there was Kanye West, who never misses a chance to steal the spotlight. Mid-show, he took the stage to deliver a dramatic rant about his critically acclaimed album *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* being snubbed for Album of the Year. \u201cI was robbed,\u201d he declared, his voice trembling with passion. \u201cThis album should have been nominated!\u201d The crowd responded with a mix of cheers and eye-rolls\u2014because let\u2019s face it, Kanye\u2019s \u201crobbed\u201d schtick is as predictable as Adele\u2019s ballads. Later, when Bon Iver won Best New Artist, Kanye almost stormed the stage (echoing his 2009 Taylor Swift interruption) before thinking better of it and sitting back down, muttering to himself. *Justin Vernon of Bon Iver looked like he\u2019d rather be milking a cow in Wisconsin than standing next to Kanye*, and who could blame him?  \n\nNot all moments were chaotic, though. The Foo Fighters, the reliable dad of the Grammys, took home Best Rock Album for *Wasting Light*. Frontman Dave Grohl gave a down-to-earth speech about making music in his garage, which was a nice palate cleanser after Nicki\u2019s supernatural spectacle. \u201cWe didn\u2019t use any fancy computers,\u201d he said. \u201cJust a bunch of guys in a room playing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll.\u201d Cue the audience\u2019s collective \u201caww\u201d and the sound of every dad in America nodding in agreement.  \n\nFashion-wise, the night had its fair share of head-scratchers. There was the star who wore a dress covered in neon feathers that looked like a peacock had a midlife crisis, and another who showed up in a suit made entirely of sequins that blinded everyone within a 10-foot radius. But let\u2019s be honest: when Nicki Minaj is walking around with a Pope lookalike, fashion takes a backseat.  \n\nAs the night wrapped up, Adele closed the show with a stripped-down performance of \u201cRolling in the Deep,\u201d reminding everyone why she was the undisputed queen of the evening. The Grammys may have been a chaotic mess, but that\u2019s the magic of it: where else can you see a soul singer cry, a rapper perform an exorcism, and Kanye West rant all in one night?  \n\nFinal verdict: The 54th Grammys was equal parts award show and circus\u2014and we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way."}

I\u2019d sit down with my child when we\u2019re both calm and ask them what they love most about using their phone\u2014whether it\u2019s connecting with friends, playing creative games, or watching educational videos. This helps me understand their perspective instead of just labeling their behavior as \u201cbad.\u201d\n\nNext, I\u2019d work with them to set clear, fair boundaries instead of imposing rules unilaterally. For example, we might agree on screen time limits (like 1 hour after finishing homework and chores) and tech-free zones or times, such as during family dinners or before bedtime. Writing these agreements down together can make them feel more accountable and respected.\n\nI\u2019d also lead by example. If I\u2019m constantly scrolling through my own phone during family time, my child will see that as the norm. So I\u2019d make a conscious effort to put my phone away when we\u2019re doing activities together\u2014whether that\u2019s playing a board game, going for a walk, or working on a craft project. Showing them that there are fulfilling offline experiences is more effective than just telling them.\n\nThen, I\u2019d help them explore alternative hobbies that align with their interests. If they love the creative aspects of phone games, we could try building with blocks or painting. If they enjoy watching videos about animals, we might visit a local zoo or start a small garden to learn about nature. The goal is to give them engaging offline options that make stepping away from the phone feel like a choice, not a punishment.\n\nI\u2019d also take the time to teach them about digital balance in age-appropriate ways. For younger kids, I might explain how too much screen time can make their eyes tired or take away time for playing outside with friends. For older kids, I could talk about the impact of endless scrolling on sleep quality or the importance of in-person interactions for building strong relationships.\n\nFinally, I\u2019d be patient and flexible. Breaking a habit takes time, so if they slip up, I\u2019d remind them gently instead of scolding them. I\u2019d also reward small wins\u2014like sticking to the screen time limit for a week\u2014with something meaningful, such as a trip to their favorite park or a chance to pick out a new book we can read together. The key is to support them in building a healthy relationship with technology, not just force them to stop using it."}

He\u2019d saved every penny from his paper route for three months to buy them [from Mr. Hiro\u2019s tiny music shop on Oak Avenue], skipping after-school slushies and trading his favorite comic book collection to a friend for extra cash. The guitar was his dad\u2019s\u2014scuffed at the body, a faint scratch on the neck from when they\u2019d tripped over the dog during a backyard jam session [two summers ago].  \n\nHis dad had left for a construction job in the Middle East six months prior, promising to be home in time for Leo\u2019s 13th birthday. Every night, they\u2019d video call, and his dad would walk him through a new chord, his voice crackling over the bad connection. \u201cSomeday, you\u2019ll play \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 so good it\u2019ll make the neighbors cry,\u201d he\u2019d say, grinning under his hard hat.  \n\nToday, Leo had nailed it. He\u2019d practiced until his fingertips blistered, replaying the chord progressions in his head during math class and at dinner. He set up his mom\u2019s old flip phone on a stack of cardboard boxes, hit record, and began to play. The notes flowed soft and steady, filling the dusty attic with the song his dad loved most. When he finished the last line, he smiled, wiping a bead of sweat from his forehead. He couldn\u2019t wait to send the recording, to hear his dad\u2019s laugh and praise.\n\nBut as he reached for the phone, the attic door creaked open. His mom stood there, her face pale, a crumpled envelope in her hand. The company logo was stamped on the front. Leo\u2019s smile faded. He knew that envelope.

He stared at his mom, his throat tight, unable to speak. The recording on the phone kept playing, his own voice singing the words his dad would never hear. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the attic windows. Somewhere below, the dog whined. Leo curled up on the floor, hugging the broken guitar to his chest, and let the tears come\u2014hot, silent, and endless. The attic smelled like dust and old wood, and for a moment, he swore he could still hear his dad\u2019s laugh, faint and distant, before it vanished into the quiet."}

Additionally, you must highlight at least 2 sections with markdown, i.e. *highlighted section*. Finally, you must add a postscript at the end of your response, starting with P.P.S", "response": "<<Practical Tips to Minimize Frequent Night Wakings in Babies>>\n\nFrequent night wakings are a common part of early parenthood, but with intentional, consistent strategies, you can help your baby develop healthier sleep patterns and reduce unnecessary disruptions. Here are actionable tips to try:\n\n*Create a Consistent, Calming Bedtime Routine*  \nA predictable pre-sleep sequence signals to your baby that it\u2019s time to wind down and prepare for rest. Aim for a 20-30 minute routine that follows the same order every night\u2014for example, a warm bath, gentle massage, reading a short picture book, and a soft lullaby. Avoid stimulating activities like screen time in the hour before bed, as blue light can suppress melatonin production, the hormone that regulates sleep. Sticking to the same bedtime (even on weekends) helps regulate your baby\u2019s circadian rhythm, making it easier for them to fall asleep and stay asleep longer.\n\n*Optimize Feeding Schedules to Avoid Night Hunger*  \nFor babies under 6 months, ensuring they get adequate nourishment during the day can reduce hunger-driven night wakings. Try cluster feeding (offering shorter, more frequent feeds) in the 2-3 hours before bedtime to top up their intake without overfeeding. For babies over 6 months, introduce nutrient-dense solid foods like oats, sweet potatoes, or avocado as part of their daily meals\u2014these can help keep them full longer through the night. Always assess if your baby is truly hungry (e.g., rooting, sucking vigorously) before offering a feed at night; sometimes fussiness stems from other needs like discomfort or a need for comfort, not hunger.\n\nSet up a sleep-friendly environment  \nYour baby\u2019s sleep space should prioritize comfort and consistency. Use blackout curtains to keep the room dark (even for early morning light), maintain a cool temperature between 18-20\u00b0C (65-68\u00b0F), and use a white noise machine to mask sudden household or outdoor sounds (like a barking dog or passing car). Ensure the crib or bassinet is safe: no loose blankets, pillows, or stuffed animals, and use a firm mattress with a fitted sheet only to reduce the risk of suffocation.\n\nRespond to night wakings strategically  \nWhen your baby wakes, first check for immediate needs: a wet diaper, teething discomfort, or a stuffy nose. If none of these are the issue, try soothing them without picking them up\u2014for example, patting their back gently, whispering, or offering a pacifier. This helps them learn to self-soothe and fall back asleep independently. Avoid bringing your baby into your bed regularly unless you\u2019re following a safe co-sleeping plan, as this can create a habit that\u2019s challenging to break later.\n\nP.P.S: It\u2019s important to remember that occasional night wakings are normal for babies, especially during growth spurts, teething phases, or developmental leaps (like learning to crawl or walk). Be patient with yourself and your baby as you navigate these changes\u2014there\u2019s no \u201cperfect\u201d sleep schedule, and every baby is different. If you notice persistent, excessive night wakings paired with other concerns like poor weight gain or daytime irritability, don\u2019t hesitate to consult your pediatrician to rule out any underlying health issues."}

The core feedback we\u2019ve gathered points to generic language, unaddressed user pain points, and a lack of clear differentiation from other dating platforms\u2014all of which are preventing Cohen from standing out in a crowded market. Below are tailored recommendations to address these issues and boost user engagement:\n\nFirst, let\u2019s tackle the critique of generic, interchangeable messaging. Phrases like \u201cFind your perfect match\u201d or \u201cEndless dating possibilities\u201d have become ubiquitous in dating app ads, making Cohen blend in rather than shine. To fix this, lean into your app\u2019s unique differentiator: the AI-powered interest verification system that links user profiles to real, active passion-based accounts (Goodreads, Strava, Spotify). Revise your headline copy to be specific and passion-driven:\n- Original: \u201cFind Your Perfect Match\u201d\n- Revised: \u201cMeet Fellow Hikers, Bookworms, or Coffee Connoisseurs\u2014People Who Share Your Actual Passions, Not Just Selfies\u201d\nThis immediately tells users what makes Cohen different and speaks to their desire to connect with someone who gets their hobbies, not just their looks.\n\nSecond, user critiques consistently note that your copy fails to address common dating app pain points: fake profiles, ghosting, and shallow conversations. To build trust, your ad copy should acknowledge these frustrations and position Cohen as the solution. For example:\n- Instead of vague promises like \u201cBuild Meaningful Connections,\u201d try: \u201cTired of Swiping Through Fake Profiles? Cohen\u2019s AI Verifies 95% of Users via Linked Passion Accounts\u2014So You Know Who You\u2019re Talking to Is Real\u201d\n- For ghosting concerns: \u201cNo More Dead-End \u2018Hey\u2019 Messages: Cohen\u2019s \u2018Connection Check-In\u2019 Prompts Meaningful Conversations to Keep Interactions Going Beyond the First Exchange\u201d\nBy naming the problem and offering a clear fix, you\u2019ll resonate with users who\u2019ve been burned by other apps.\n\nThird, your current copy lacks emotional storytelling that helps users imagine their own success on Cohen. Generic statements don\u2019t create a personal connection, but relatable anecdotes do. Incorporate short, authentic user stories into your ad copy:\n- \u201cLast Month, Mia (a 32-Year-Old Graphic Designer and Plant Parent) Met Jake on Cohen\u2014They Bonded Over Their Shared Obsession with Rare Succulents and Now Weekend Plant Shopping Is Their Thing. Could That Be You?\u201d\nAlternatively, use a conversational tone that feels like a friend giving advice: \u201cLet\u2019s Be Real: Dating Apps Can Feel Like a Chore. Cohen\u2019s Here to Make It Feel Like a Fun Way to Meet People Who Get You.\u201d\n\nFourth, your one-size-fits-all copy misses the mark with specific user segments. Tailor your messaging to different audiences to increase relevance:\n- For millennials and Gen Z: \u201cSick of Dating Apps That Treat You Like a Swipe? Cohen Matches You with People Who Care About the Same Things You Do\u2014Whether That\u2019s Debating the Latest Indie Film or Perfecting Your Sourdough Starter\u201d\n- For users over 40 seeking long-term connections: \u201cLooking for a Meaningful Connection, Not a Quick Fling? Cohen\u2019s Community Prioritizes Depth Over Drama\u2014Meet Someone Who Shares Your Life Experiences and Values\u201d\n\nFinally, your current call-to-action (CTA) buttons are weak and generic (\u201cSign Up Now\u201d). Revise them to be specific, urgent, and tied to your unique value:\n- \u201cJoin Cohen\u2019s Plant Parent Community This Week\u2014First 100 Sign-Ups Get a Free Virtual Plant Swap Invite!\u201d\n- \u201cDownload Cohen Today and Meet Your Next Hiking Buddy by the Weekend\u201d\n\nThese revisions will help Cohen cut through the noise, build trust with potential users, and drive sign-ups from people who are genuinely looking for the kind of connections your app is designed to foster. I\u2019d be happy to collaborate on A/B testing these revised copy variations to measure their impact on click-through and conversion rates.\n\nThank you for considering these suggestions. I\u2019m excited to see Cohen\u2019s messaging evolve to better reflect its unique strengths and connect with users on a deeper level.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nMarketing Strategy Consultant\n[Your Email]\n[Your Phone Number]"}

{"prompt": "Provide a detailed analysis of the lobbying efforts of these major tech companies, focusing on the specific issues they prioritize and the potential impact on their businesses and the broader tech industry. However, do not include any specific lobbying spending figures or dollar amounts in your analysis.\n\nYour response should be in German language, and no other language is allowed.", "response": "Die Lobbyarbeit gro\u00dfer Technologieunternehmen zielt darauf ab, Rahmenbedingungen zu gestalten, die ihre Gesch\u00e4ftsinteressen sch\u00fctzen und gleichzeitig Raum f\u00fcr Innovationen lassen. Ihre Priorit\u00e4ten richten sich nach den zentralen Herausforderungen der Branche, und die Ergebnisse ihrer Bem\u00fchungen wirken sich nicht nur auf ihre eigenen Gesch\u00e4fte aus, sondern auch auf die gesamte Tech-Landschaft und die digitale Gesellschaft. Hier ist eine detaillierte Analyse ihrer wichtigsten Fokusbereiche:\n\n### 1. Datenschutz und Digitale Privatsph\u00e4re\nUnternehmen wie Apple setzen sich intensiv f\u00fcr strenge Verschl\u00fcsselungsregeln ein und lobbyieren gegen verpflichtende Hintert\u00fcren in Kommunikationsdiensten. Dies ist nicht nur Teil ihrer Markenidentit\u00e4t \u2013 Datenschutz gilt als zentrales Verkaufsargument \u2013 sondern auch eine Ma\u00dfnahme, um das Vertrauen von Kunden zu wahren. Google und Meta hingegen streben eher harmonisierte Datenschutzvorgaben in der EU an, statt fragmentierter nationaler Regelungen. F\u00fcr sie bedeutet eine einheitliche Rechtsgrundlage geringere Compliance-Kosten und weniger administrative Aufwendungen.  \n**Auswirkungen**: Wenn Verschl\u00fcsselungsrechte gesch\u00fctzt bleiben, st\u00e4rkt dies das Vertrauen der Nutzer in digitale Dienste insgesamt. Harmonisierte Regeln erleichtern es auch kleineren Unternehmen, in mehreren M\u00e4rkten zu operieren, ohne sich an unterschiedliche Vorschriften anpassen zu m\u00fcssen. F\u00fcr die gro\u00dfen Techs sichert dies ihre Kundenbindung und reduziert rechtliche Unsicherheiten.\n\n### 2. Wettbewerb und Kartellrecht\nAmazon lobbyiert gegen Regelungen, die eine Trennung von Marktplatz und Logistikdienstleistungen erzwingen w\u00fcrden \u2013 die Integration dieser Bereiche ist zentral f\u00fcr seine schnelle Lieferkapazit\u00e4t und Wettbewerbsf\u00e4higkeit. Google verteidigt sich gegen Regeln, die seine Suchmaschinen-Dominanz einschr\u00e4nken, wie die Digital Markets Act (DMA) in der EU: Bei strenger Durchsetzung k\u00f6nnte es gezwungen sein, seine Suchmaschine von Diensten wie YouTube oder Google Maps zu trennen, was seine Einnahmequellen aus Werbung und integrierten Angeboten beeintr\u00e4chtigen w\u00fcrde. Meta k\u00e4mpft gegen Kartellverfahren, die seine Dominanz auf den Sozialmedien attackieren.  \n**Auswirkungen**: Strengere Kartellregeln k\u00f6nnten das Spielfeld f\u00fcr kleinere Wettbewerber ebnen, aber auch die Innovationskraft gro\u00dfer Unternehmen beeintr\u00e4chtigen, da sie weniger Ressourcen f\u00fcr langfristige Projekte investieren k\u00f6nnten. F\u00fcr die betroffenen Unternehmen bedeutet dies, ihre Gesch\u00e4ftsstrukturen anzupassen oder Ums\u00e4tze einzub\u00fc\u00dfen.\n\n### 3. K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz (KI)-Regulierung\nAlle gro\u00dfen Tech-Unternehmen setzen sich f\u00fcr ausgewogene KI-Regeln ein, die Innovationen f\u00f6rdern und gleichzeitig Risiken mindern. Microsoft pl\u00e4diert f\u00fcr eine Kombination aus Selbstregulierung und gezielter Aufsicht, insbesondere f\u00fcr hochrisikobehaftete Anwendungen wie medizinische Diagnostik. Google hingegen betont die Bedeutung von offenen KI-Frameworks und lobbyiert gegen Regelungen, die die Verbreitung von quelloffener KI einschr\u00e4nken w\u00fcrden.  \n**Auswirkungen**: Klare Rechtsgrundlagen reduzieren Unsicherheiten und erm\u00f6glichen es den Unternehmen, sicher in KI-Forschung und -Entwicklung zu investieren. Zu strenge Regeln k\u00f6nnten die Entwicklung verlangsamen und ihnen gegen\u00fcber Wettbewerbern aus Regionen mit weniger strengen Vorschriften einen Nachteil verschaffen. Aus branchenweiter Sicht schaffen ausgewogene Regeln Sicherheit f\u00fcr alle Akteure und f\u00f6rdern die verantwortungsvolle Nutzung von KI.\n\n### 4. Urheberrecht und Inhaltsverwaltung\nMeta und YouTube (zu Google geh\u00f6rig) lobbyieren f\u00fcr fairere Lizenzierungsbedingungen f\u00fcr nutzergenerierte Inhalte. Sie streben nach Ausnahmen von der Haftung f\u00fcr Inhalte, die von Nutzern hochgeladen werden, sowie nach reduzierten Lizenzkosten f\u00fcr Musik oder Videos in solchen Inhalten. Wenn die Haftung erh\u00f6ht w\u00fcrde, m\u00fcssten sie erheblich mehr Ressourcen auf Inhaltsmoderation und Lizenzierung verwenden \u2013 ein Aufwand, der ihre Gewinne beeintr\u00e4chtigen w\u00fcrde.  \n**Auswirkungen**: G\u00fcnstigere Regelungen erm\u00f6glichen es ihnen, ihre Plattformen offen und zug\u00e4nglich zu halten, ohne \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfige Kosten zu tragen. F\u00fcr die gesamte Branche schaffen klare Urheberrechtsregeln Sicherheit f\u00fcr kleinere Plattformen, die nicht vor unsicheren Haftungsrisiken stehen m\u00fcssen.\n\n### 5. Arbeitsrecht im Tech-Bereich\nAmazon setzt sich gegen strengere Regelungen zur Klassifizierung von Gig-Mitarbeitern ein: Die flexible Nutzung von Lieferfahrern als selbstst\u00e4ndige Unternehmer ist zentral f\u00fcr seine schnelle Skalierbarkeit und niedrigen Arbeitskosten. Wenn diese Fahrer als Angestellte eingestuft w\u00fcrden, w\u00fcrde die Arbeitskostenlast deutlich steigen. Microsoft hingegen konzentriert sich auf Regelungen zum Homeoffice, um die Flexibilit\u00e4t f\u00fcr seine Mitarbeiter zu wahren.  \n**Auswirkungen**: Flexible Arbeitsregeln erm\u00f6glichen es Tech-Unternehmen, schnell auf Marktver\u00e4nderungen zu reagieren und mit geringeren Kosten zu skalieren. Strengere Regelungen k\u00f6nnten jedoch die Arbeitsbedingungen f\u00fcr Gig-Mitarbeiter verbessern und zu einer faireren Verteilung von Vorteilen f\u00fchren.\n\n### Fazit\nDie Lobbyarbeit gro\u00dfer Tech-Unternisse spiegelt ihre aktuellen Herausforderungen und Chancen wider. W\u00e4hrend ihre Bem\u00fchungen oft auf den Schutz ihrer eigenen Gesch\u00e4ftsinteressen abzielen, haben sie weitreichende Auswirkungen auf die gesamte Branche: Sie k\u00f6nnen die Innovationsgeschwindigkeit bestimmen, das Wettbewerbsfeld ausgleichen oder die Rechte von Nutzern und Mitarbeitern beeinflussen. Regulierungsbeh\u00f6rden stehen vor der Aufgabe, eine Balance zwischen den Interessen gro\u00dfer Unternehmen und den Bed\u00fcrfnissen der Gesellschaft zu finden, um eine nachhaltige und faire digitale Zukunft zu schaffen."}
